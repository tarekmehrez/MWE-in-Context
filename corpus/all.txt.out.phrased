bacteriological_water_analysis is a method of analysing water to estimate the numbers of bacteria present and if needed to find out what sort of bacteria they are it is a microbiological_analytical_procedure which uses samples of water and from these samples determines the concentration of bacteria it is then possible to draw_inferences about the suitability of the water for use from these concentrations this process is used for example to routinely confirm that water is safe for human_consumption or that bathing and recreational_waters are safe to use
the interpretation and the action_trigger_levels for different waters vary depending on the use made of the water very stringent levels applying to drinking_water whilst more relaxed levels apply to marine_bathing_waters where much lower volumes of water are expected to be ingested by users
the common feature of all these routine_screening_procedures is that the primary analysis is for indicator_organisms rather than the pathogens that might cause concern indicator_organisms are bacteria such as non specific coliforms escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa that are very commonly found in the human or animal gut and which if detected may suggest the presence of sewage indicator_organisms are used because even when a person is infected with a more pathogenic bacteria they will still be excreting many millions times more indicator_organisms than pathogens it is therefore reasonable to surmise that if indicator_organism levels are low then pathogen_levels will be very much lower or absent judgements as to suitability of water for use are based on very extensive precedents and relate to the probability of any sample_population of bacteria being able to be infective at a reasonable statistical_level_of_confidence
analysis is usually performed using culture biochemical and sometimes optical methods when indicator_organisms levels exceed pre set triggers specific analysis for pathogens may then be undertaken and these can be quickly detected where suspected using specific culture_methods or molecular_biology
because the analysis is always based on a very small sample taken from a very large volume of water all methods rely on statistical principles
one of the oldest methods is called the multiple_tube_method in this method a measured sub sample perhaps ml is diluted with ml of sterile growth_medium and an aliquot of ml is then decanted into each of ten tubes the remaining ml is then diluted again and the process repeated at the end of dilutions this produces tubes covering the dilution range of through to 
the tubes are then incubated at a pre set temperature for a specified time and at the end of the process the number of tubes with growth in is counted for each dilution statistical tables are then used to derive the concentration of organisms in the original sample this method can be enhanced by using indicator_medium which changes colour when acid_forming species are present and by including a tiny inverted tube in each sample_tube this inverted tube catches any gas produced the production of gas at deg celsius is a strong indication of the presence of escherichia coli
an atp_test is the process of rapidly measuring active microorganisms in water through detection of a molecule called adenosine triphosphate or atp
atp is a molecule found only in and around living cells and as such it gives a direct measure of biological_concentration and health atp is quantified by measuring the light produced through its reaction with the naturally occurring firefly_enzyme luciferase using a luminometer the amount of light produced is directly_proportional to the amount of biological_energy present in the sample
nd generation atp_tests are specifically designed for water wastewater and industrial_applications where for the most part samples contain a variety of components that can interfere with the atp_assay
the plate_count_method relies on bacteria growing a colony on a nutrient_medium so that the colony becomes visible to the naked eye and the number of colonies on a plate can be counted to be effective the dilution of the original sample must be arranged so that on average between and colonies of the target_bacterium are grown fewer than colonies makes the interpretation statistically unsound whilst greater than colonies often results in overlapping colonies and imprecision in the count to ensure that an appropriate number of colonies will be generated several dilutions are normally cultured
the laboratory procedure involves making_serial_dilutions of the sample etc in sterile water and cultivating these on nutrient_agar in a dish that is sealed and incubated typical media include plate count agar for a general count or macconkey agar to count gram negative bacteria such as e coli typically one set of plates is incubated at c and for hours and a second set at c for hours the composition of the nutrient usually includes reagents that resist the growth of non target_organisms and make the target_organism easily identified often by a colour_change in the medium some recent methods include a fluorescent_agent so that counting of the colonies can be automated at the end of the incubation_period the colonies are counted by eye a procedure that takes a few moments and does not require a microscope as the colonies are typically a few millimetres across
most modern laboratories use a refinement of total_plate_count in which serial_dilutions of the sample are vacuum_filtered through purpose_made_membrane_filters and these filters are themselves laid on nutrient_medium within sealed plates the methodology is otherwise similar to conventional total_plate_counts membranes have a printed millimetre_grid printed on and can be reliably count a much greater number of colonies under a binocular microscope
when the analysis is looking for bacterial_species that grow poorly in air the initial analysis is done by mixing serial_dilutions of the sample in liquid nutrient_agar which is then poured into bottles which are then sealed and laid on their sides to produce a sloping agar_surface colonies that develop in the body of the medium can be counted by eye after incubation
the total number of colonies is referred to as the total viable count tvc the unit_of_measurement is cfuml or colony_forming_units per millilitre and relates to the original sample calculation of this is a multiple of the counted number of colonies multiplied by the dilution used
when samples show elevated levels of indicator_bacteria further analysis is often undertaken to look for specific pathogenic bacteria species commonly investigated in the temperate_zone include salmonella typhi and salmonella typhimurium
depending on the likely source of contamination investigation may also extend to organisms such as cryptosporidium spp
in tropical areas analysis of vibrio cholerae is also routinely undertaken
macconkey agar is culture_medium designed to grow gram negative bacteria and stain them for lactose_fermentation it contains bile_salts to inhibit most gram positive bacteria crystal_violet dye which also inhibits certain gram positive bacteria neutral red dye which stains microbes fermenting lactose lactose and peptone alfred theodore macconkey developed it while working as a bacteriologist for the royal commission on sewage disposal in the united kingdom
endo_medium contains peptone lactose dipotassium_phosphate agar sodium_sulfite basic fuchsin and was originally developed for the isolation of salmonella typhi but is now commonly used in water_analysis as in macconkey agar coliform_organisms ferment the lactose and the colonies become red non lactose fermenting organisms produce clear colourless colonies against the faint_pink background of the medium
mfc_medium is a medium used in membrane_filtration which contains selective and differential agents these include rosolic_acid to inhibit bacterial_growth in general except for faecal_coliforms bile_salts inhibit non enteric bacteria and aniline_blue indicates the ability of faecal_coliforms to ferment lactose to acid that causes a ph_change in the medium
tyea_medium contains tryptone yeast_extract common_salt and l arabinose per liter of glass distilledwater and is a non_selective medium usually cultivated at two temperatures and c to determine a general level of contamination aka colony_count

bearing a hourglass is a fantasy_novel by piers anthony it is the second of eight books in the incarnations of immortality series
norton accepts the position of incarnation of time and continues his life living backwards in time
some time in the future as evidenced by technology in use that is much more advanced than in the first story nortona man of about fortyis living a life of nomadic_wandering when a ghost named gawain asks him to father a child to his widow orlene with whom norton eventually falls_in love gawain then asks gaea the incarnation of nature to make the child in his own likeness so his bloodline would continue unfortunately the child ends up dead due to a disease that runs in gawains family orlene then commits suicide
feeling depressed about the disastrous results of his affair with orlene norton is approached by gawain again who offers norton the position of time chronos where he must rule over all earthly aspects of time gawain explains to norton that chronos lives backwards in time until the moment of the birth or conception it is never made clear of the office_holders previous self who is still living forwards the ghost baits norton explaining to him that by living backwards he can continue to see orlene since she is still alive in the past norton accepts and gawain leads him to the spot where the future office_holder of time nortons predecessor will pass the hourglass onto norton
norton immediately starts literally living life backwards in time though he can temporarily go forward in order to interact with others however when he is living backwards he is not visible to mortals norton experiments with his hourglass recognized by all the incarnations as being the most powerful magical device in the world to halt andor reverse time travel many millions of years into the earths past and work with the incarnation of fate who needs his hourglass to help fix tangles in her threads_of_fate
because norton lives backwards in time his past is everyone elses future making him an isolated character even among the other incarnations he also realises that this will make it impossible to have_a_relationship with the forward living orlene he does however have_an_affair with clotho the youngest aspect of fate this is both awkward and intriguing to norton since her past is his future
residing at his new residence in purgatory norton is then visited by satan who informs norton that while he can travel anywhere in time with his hourglass he cannot leave earth satan claims to have the power to travel the whole universe since evil permeates all of reality and gives norton some samples of this ability by having him travel to other planets where satan claims time_flows backwards allowing norton to live normally and to get involved in both a space_opera bat durston and the bems and an epic_fantasy_adventure satan offers norton the ability to have that power if norton will grant satan a favor to go back in time years and save a man from committing suicide
norton goes back in time to check out this young man but after consulting with the other incarnations he is informed that this man is the current office_holder of the incarnation of death thanatosin other words zane from the previous novel and that it is zanes attempted suicide that brought him to that position this man is needed as thanatos in order to protect his girlfriend luna kaftan from satans mischief so she can go_into_politics and fulfill a prophecy of thwarting satan
however a relic satan had given norton turned out to be a demon in disguise when norton went back in time the demon disembarked a few years in the past to prevent luna from going_into_politics the demon gives an incumbent politician an antidote to keep him alive so luna doesnt take_his_place due to some of the limitations of the hourglass intercepting this demon is difficult but norton eventually manages to stop_it
not giving up satan tries one more time by trapping norton on one of the other planets he had_an_adventure on not sure how to get back home norton starts toying with the hourglass traveling all the way back to the beginning of the observable universe and all the way to its end from the big_bang to the point where all matter became trapped in black_holes and realizes that since the incarnations magic does not extend beyond earth his adventures on other planets were illusions created by satan and that norton had in fact never left earth
norton then finds out that the demon that created the illusion had been attached to him and once again disembarked at a point in the past two years after the events of the first book to begin a campaign to discredit luna so she doesnt run_for office norton then goes back in time to this point and uses his hourglass to show the world all the bad things that will happen if luna doesnt get elected as norton is no longer fooled by satans illusions satan stops trying to exploit him
times hourglass is recognized as the most powerful single item any incarnation possesses and it is all chronos needs it has an incredibly large variety of functions all controlled by times will it can move chronos forward or backward in time reverse his personal time to allow him to interact with others and pause time for himself or his local area which is not a true stasis as most of the world continues as normal how this syncs up is never explained it is simply magic he can reverse time temporarily in an area which simply rewinds a scene without the mortal participants being aware of it which allows him to choose another course for it he can also choose to put_the_entire_world_into_stasis or even reverse time for the entire world which he is forced to do at one point in addition times hourglass is also his method of travel by selectively moving himself slightly out of sync with the earths rotation and orbit as he travels in time he can use it to travel in space this travel is of course failsafed to not allow him to end up in deep_space or inside a wall or the earth itself times hourglass cannot be broken or lost as any attempt to leave it behind will simply cause it to float at the same relative distance it was released it can however be folded up for easy storage though it still functions just as well
much like the other incarnations times robe protects him from any kind of physical harm like the other incarnations he is immortal and cannot be killed before it is time to pass on the office anything attempting to attack him would be immediately aged into oblivion upon contact his robe is also the default_area for his personal time_flow though he can of course expand it to bring other things along with him when he travels
while not an official device of time sning is a valuable companion to norton throughout his career a demonic though benign creature it takes_the_form of a ring in the shape of a snake where it gets the name norton gave it standing for snake_ring while not omnipotent sning has an incredible amount of information and appears to be able to learn many things about creatures just by touching them it can respond to any question asked of it by squeezing the wearers finger one squeeze for yes two for no three for uncertainty complex answers or inability to answer for example if the asker foolishly poses a non yesno question it can also answer with squeezes representing a number though sning is actually quite bad at math much to its embarrassment in addition it is capable of coming alive briefly scouting an area and reporting back while alive it is approximately six inches long though it is shown that he can grow and also poisonous its poison is strong enough to make a creature the size of a man sick for several hours but not to kill 
sning has a long and complex history originally belonging to mym the prince fated to become the incarnation of war he later gave it to orb the eventual incarnation of nature when they were forced to part who gave it to her daughter orlene the eventual incarnation of good she eventually bestowed it to norton as a gift despite being in the possession of four major incarnations sning was actually only named by norton and he was the only one to use him during his actual time as an incarnation
time because of his nature is the only incarnation that is actually required to pass along his office at an exact schedule though time can travel to any period he cannot actually interact with the world outside the span of his own lifetime thus as he lives backwards when his lifetime is up he must pass on the office to an heir though he has some ability to plan the transfer the exact timing and the fact that he lives backwards means he has very little ability to actually enact it he is forced to simply leave the hourglass and hope whoever he has set up to take it does so the hourglass will entice those around it to pick it up for there must be an incarnation of time but it does not always go smoothly there is one instance mentioned where the proposed new officeholder refused the position and it fell to a nearby seven year old boy who happened to pick up the hourglass again though the position would appear to be gender_neutral it is traditionally held by a male
time is responsible for scheduling all human events to make sure everything runs smoothly and the natural_laws like cause_and_effect are honored he works most closely with fate helping her to fix crossed threads caused by human error or simply random_chance he also schedules notable births and deaths important events in peoples lives and in history and makes sure the flow of time remains stable when it is bent as it is by his allowance that the other incarnations are also capable of local timestops he is also responsible for guaranteeing that the course of history flows as it should as time he is immune to paradox and to the possibility of multiple futures should actions occur to change the course of the future his memories will change with it however typically his original memories are accepted as the desirable ones as one of his major tasks is to make sure it does not get changed around without adequate reason this is of course why he lives backwards he would be unable to properly deal with making the future happen as planned if he was unaware of the plan
jackie cassada in the library journal review says that amid weight and often convoluted speculations about the nature of good and evil time and space and magic and science anthonys irrepressible humor asserts itself in unexpected ways far from being grim or even allegorical this sequel to on a pale horse will appeal to anthonys large readership
bodufenvalhuge sidi or assayyidhu bodufenvalhugey seedhee was a much celebrated maldivian intellectual and writer
bodufenvalhuge sidi born on may as hussain el hussaini was bodufenvalhuge don manike and mohamed kuda sidis son
he was a poet and also one_time_chief_justice
he married eight ladies and had five surviving children from four of these marriages his first wife was bodugalhuge aysha didi daughter of bodugaluge lhatuttu didi 
among his descendants are ahmed mujuthaba and mohamed mustafa who are both prominent in maldivian administration and politics
bodufenvalhuge sidi spent several years of his youth in addu atoll with his maternal relatives addu atoll was the main centre_of_learning in the maldives at that time the turn_of_the_century he was educated there by a well known master and relative elhage abdullahi didi son of ganduvaru hasan didi also known as don beyya of meedhu
bodufenvalhuge sidi was credited with many of the developments in maldivian poetry in theth century he was the last major poet to write in the maldivian poetic style called raivaru and one of the first poets to write in the style called lhen bodufenvalhuge sidis early poems were mainly political_satire 
in an attempt_was_made to depose sultan mohamed shamsuddin iii in favour of prince abdulla imaduddin son of the deposed king siri kula sundhura katthiri bavana sultan mohamed imaduddine vi the deposed king was exiled in egypt while abdulla imaduddine was on a visit to male from egypt the attempt was foiled in february and abdulla imaduddine was deported to egypt the other conspirators were banished to various atolls of the maldives
bodufenvalhuge sidi the most well educated and widely_respected of the conspirators was accused of masterminding the plot he denied the charge and claimed that he advised strongly against the timing and the modus_operandi in the plot
bodufenvalhuge sidi engaged in hunger_strike and refused to answer any questions saying that he had done nothing wrong after he had agreed to take_his_food he insisted that it nust be delivered from his residence he was successful in having this wish granted and at every meal_time his brother in law beruge yoosuf fulhu turned up with his meals and waited there while he ate bodufenvalhuge sidi was implying that he did not trust the maldivian authorities
usually the authorities meted out summary_justice in cases such as that the victim would be taken outside and given_a_good_flogging with a cat o nine tails until he was covered in blood then lonumirus chilli_paste would be applied to his wounds and he would be banished to a remote island
in bodufenvalhuge sidis case they were reluctant to do so because the british had become aware of the situation the maldives was then a british protectorate even though the british were bund by a treaty not to interfere in the internal_affairs of the maldives
bodufenvalhuge sidi was banished to hulhudheli in a southern atoll many of hismaternal relatives from addu atoll regularly stopped at that island for provisions and water on their way to and from male the authorities then became suspicious and decided to send him to maamakunudhu the remotest of the northern islands 
in exile in maamakunudu island sidi continued to pursue his literary_work and wrote much of his poetry it was there that he adopted his pen name of himaarul qowm or donkey of the nation
he distributed his poetry then banned by the government to his associates in male through an ex wife of his maavaa kileygefaanu ganduvaru goma and his sister bodufenvalhuge don didi
bodufenvalhuge sidi remained on maamakunudu island for eight years until he was pardoned in a general_amnesty following the forced abdication of king shamsuddin upon arrival in male he was appointed chief_justice he was also appointed to the council of regency that ruled in the absence of a sultan
after bodufenvalhuge sidi returned to male he continued to write poetry and a few novelsand other books he was the last known person with a working knowledge of the older maldive script called dhives akuru
as sayyid bodufenvalhuge sidi was one of the very few maldivian people of modern_times who understood the now forgotten ancient divehi letters in which parts of royal grants warrants and deeds were written he learnt this ancient dhivehi writing_systems in addu atoll until early in the twentieth century all government_correspondence to and from addu atoll was written using these ancient divehi letters
apart from a stint in politics as the minister_of_education bodufenvalhuge sidi remained in the legalecclesiastical professions his literary_work gradually became less radical and moreconventional with age
bodufenvalhuge sidi died in male on june 
best_known among his novels were dillygey ibrahim didi ge vaahaka and maa makunudu bodu isa ge vaahaka he also published a treatise on maldive poetry called divehi lhen hedumuge masaikaiyterikamuge ran taraadu
in during sultan mohammed farids reign former prime_minister and later president ibrahim nasir expressed_a_wish to have a book written about the former maldivian script which by that time was largely ignored by maldivians thus he contacted as sayyid bodufenvalhuge sidi who swiftly obliged and wrote dhivehi akuru by means of this small book bodufenvalhuge sidi wanted to clearly show the fact that in ancient_times maldivians were writing from left to right in their own script hence divehi akuru is perhaps the only book ever written in tna that opens from the left side
the last chapter of this book shows a text where the divehi akuru are coming along with arabic script as the reader acquainted with maldivian writing can see this book is volume evvana bai perhaps bodufenvalhuge sidi had the intention of publishing a second or perhaps even a third volume on the subject but unfortunately this important maldivian learned_man died before being able to do so
even though hcp bell did_a_very_careful_and_thorough_research on the maldivian documents prime_minister ibrahim nasirs intention was to have a book on the ancient script of the maldives written by a maldivian prime_minister nasirs request to bodufenvalhuge sidi was done in order to clarify hcp bells misinterpretations no matter how few a staunch maldivian nationalist nasir took this issue as a matter of national pride
present_day_members of maldivian cultural_institutions are aware of the lacunae in bells research and of bodufenvalhuge sidis valuable contribution to mend matters but little has been done to correct those inaccuracies still hcp bells broad and valuable contributions to the study of the maldivian language and scripts should not be underestimated

caldwell lettered in basketball football and track he worked in his mothers family drug_store during his teen years caldwell also played semi professional baseball in north louisiana while he was still in high_school as did several other louisiana politicians including the late education_superintendent bill dodd and former state_representatives lantz womack of winnsboro the seat of franklin parish and ld buddy napper of ruston the seat of lincoln parish 
caldwell earned his bachelor_of_arts_degree in psychology with a minor in history from tulane university in new orleans where he also played_football and ran track in he received his law_degree from the tulane university law school and thereafter established his solo law_practice in tallulah which he maintained until becoming district_attorney six years later
caldwell was first elected district_attorney of the small sixth judicial district on september when he was thirty two he assumed the office which is located in tallulah on january from caldwell served on the board_of_directors of the louisiana district_attorneys association while district_attorney he personally tried felony_cases in his district suspects rarely won_acquittal when caldwell was the prosecutor critics however note that caldwell maintained a high conviction_rate by not prosecuting the hard cases caldwell also claimed the highest per_capita_collection_rate for back_child_support in the state

former legislative_auditor dan kyle of baton rouge an unsuccessful republican candidate for insurance_commissioner in was a leading critic of caldwells attorney_general candidacy kyle reported that in caldwell spent in da_office_funds to pay for personal_items including clothing and golfing_expenses the expenses included air_fare to montana and golf_fees in alabama
according to the advocate kyle claimed that caldwell tried to quash release of parts of the audit and used foul_language and threats in an unsuccessful attempt to block the audit then kyle accused caldwell of having blamed his own secretary for the questionable spending caldwell also said the spending_problem in the audit was a mistake by his secretary adding that he personally brought it to the auditors attention in committee_room during a legislation_probe mr caldwell was testified against by the auditor who stated that mr caldwell said some very racist remarks because the police jury we were issuing the audit on were all minorities he told me i just needed a white_man to issue an audit on i saidno the findings are the same youve done the same thing these people have done and justice is justice and i have to issue both reports and if youll look at them they both have the same data on them the auditor stated that he was later told mr caldwell is a loose cannon out to get you he is dangerous you need protection 
three years later caldwell accused kyles investigators of an array of questionable activities ranging from improperly bugging conversations to having_sex with witnesses in audit_investigations in testimony before the legislative audit advisory council caldwell told the council that state_auditors working in north louisiana had suppressed evidence secretly tape recorded interviews with witnesses and compromised the credibility of witnesses in possible criminal_investigations caldwell later told reporters he also knew of instances of an auditor in kyles office having_sexual relations with people being audited caldwell gave_no_details according to kyle

 is a video_game produced by konami for the sharp x home_computer in its original double_floppy_disk_form the game was never released outside of japan since the sharp x was exclusive to the japanese market it has been unofficially dubbed akumaj dracula x and castlevania x to differentiate it from other games in the series that are also_called akumaj dracula 
in the original version was ported and enhanced by konami as castlevania chronicles for the playstation gaming_console the game was released outside of japan making akumaj dracula available to the north american and european markets for the first time castlevania chronicles was made available for download via the playstation network as a psone classic on december 
akumaj dracula is a game based on castlevania with a completely new engine designed to take_advantage_of the sharp x hardware the entire game is completely updated including familiar stages that have been redesigned as well as brand_new stages altogether it contains all of the special items and sub weapons from the original game as well as an exclusive rare item known as the laurel which refills six health_blocks for hearts this game is also notable for its high difficulty_level 
like the original akumaj dracula game hidden items worth points and hidden ups will appear throughout the game if the player ducks or stands in particular portions of a level another notable feature is the multiple loops after the game is completed previous castlevania games had increased difficulty for the games second playthrough an increased amount of damage taken from enemies in earlier levels as well as new enemy_placement and attack_patterns were just a few things to make the second playthrough more difficult this game however has as many as six additional playthroughs with each one becoming much more difficult than the last there are even cases of special easter_eggs on the sixth playthrough on stage block a cartoon image of simon will appear in a set of mirrors smoking a cigarette accompanied by japanese text in one of the background_areas saying heres fake simon
the playstation re release castlevania chronicles expanded much more to the x game this includes a brand_new rendered intro and ending with new character designs by ayami kojima of castlevania symphony of the night fame a new sprite_design for simon belmont and dracula improved graphical effects enhanced music and sound_effects and a more balanced and adjustable difficulty_level players can choose to play this arrange mode version of the game with all of the new features intact or play the original mode version as it was originally presented on the sharp x
completing portions of the arrange mode also unlocks special features including an art_gallery as well as a time attack mode exclusive to the us and european versions of chronicles the art_gallery features artwork by ayami kojima for chronicles and castlevania symphony of the night the latter game_images were already featured in the sega saturn version of symphony the art of the succubus is censored since her chest in the original was topless the time attack mode allows the player to race through any stage complete with a time_meter to beat their best time
also exclusive to the us and european versions of chronicles is an interview with koji iga igarishi
the storyline for both akumaj dracula x and castlevania chronicles is the same as the original akumaj dracula game simon belmont has to set out to defeat the evil count dracula who has been terrorizing the area 
in the year the evil count dracula has risen once again after a century of rest to terrorize the people of transylvania simon belmont picks up the vampire killer whip and sets out to castlevania to destroy the lord of darkness and restore peace to europe
the introduction to both versions of this remake retell the story of draculas resurrection in followers of dracula perform a ritual to revive him at the start of the game
the music for the x game contains a variety of new arrangements of familiar tunes from the series as well as brand_new compositions altogether the familiar songs include vampire killer and wicked child from the original castlevania bloody tears from castlevania ii simons quest and theme of simon belmont from super castlevania iv before each game the player is given_a_choice between three different sound_modules the xs fm synthesizer midi roland la mt cm l cm and midi roland gs sc sc sc cm cm while the soundtrack will remain the same throughout the game regardless of which sound_module is chosen the instrumentation may vary and some songs will be arranged slightly differently
sta fujimori staff_composer for the konami corporation in japan performed all new arrangements of the soundtrack for castlevania chronicles arrange mode while many songs remain very similar to their akumajo dracula x counterparts except with studio recorded live synth and other live instrumentation a handful of songs are given a techno_feel some of these songs include vampire killer which now contains pieces of prologue and stalker from castlevania thrashard in the cave which is more ambient than its original version and wicked child in the japanese chronicles unlike the us and european versions the sound_hardware_selection_screen automatically appears before starting a game on original mode just as it did in akumaj dracula x a code must be entered to reach it in either mode in the us and european versions while the japanese version only requires one to be entered in arrange mode
while the original mode presented on chronicles is otherwise identical to the x game there are a few limitations since it is emulated on different hardware one noticeable difference is the brief loading_times that now appear before boss_fights and stages the other drawback is the lack of an internal clock on the playstation the original game utilized the xs internal time and date_settings the time on the clock_tower during the boss_fight on stage would reflect the xs current time and the color_scheme used on the painting in stage would reflect one of the four seasons according to the computers current date on the playstation game each time the system is turned on the time and date have to be manually adjusted only after a hidden extra option menu is accessed by inputting an altered version of the konami code
during regular gameplay there are a few noticeable changes between the japanese release and the useuropean release of chronicles the marionettes on stage cry out yamete stop_in japanese and omae wa dare who are you in japanese when attacked in akumaj dracula x and the japanese chronicles for localization_purposes they are silent other than when they are destroyed in the us and european versions audio wise the japanese version of chronicles had slowdown_issues with the music_playback these were fixed for the us and european releases lastly exclusive to arrange mode on the us and european versions the player can save the game at stage the battle with dracula
ign rated the playstation release saying it did not quite measure up with later titles but was still a lot of fun gamespot gave that same release a saying it lacked replay_value and was graphically outdated

daphne moon crane born september is a fictional character on the american television sitcom frasier played by jane leeves
daphne is a recent immigrant from england who is employed by frasier crane as a live in housekeeper and physical_therapist for his father martin her quirky personality and claims of psychic abilities provided comic_relief on the show while her relationship with frasiers brother niles crane was a major dramatic plotline during the run of the series progressing from niles secret infatuation at the beginning of the show to their marriage at the beginning of season ten the role was originally to be filled by lisa maxwell who left before production began due to a dispute with producers
daphne was born in manchester england the only_daughter in a large working_class family of nine children she spent much of her childhood playing nurse and housemaid to her brothers she has a complex love hate relationship with her domineering and ever complaining mother gertrude moon played by millicent martin her relationship with her father harry played by brian cox is much warmer and closer 
as a young girl daphne was an actress in the fictional hit british sitcom mind your knickers a show about ethnically diverse twelve year olds in a private girls boarding_school possibly named in reference to the s british sitcom mind your language her career ended at age when she became too tall and busty to play her short pre teen character during her youth she gained considerable skill at billiards claiming to have won many tournaments after working at a convenience_store which she implies was robbed daphne then took up a career as a physical_therapist working one on one with various invalids and shut ins at an indeterminate time she migrates across the atlantic to live in seattle seeking a new life free of her domineering family in the third season_finale you can go home again it is revealed that prior to being hired by the cranes she had_a_chance_encounter with them at cafe nervosa in the first season_premiere the good son daphne is hired by frasier crane to assist frasiers father martin crane with his daily activities and exercises martin suffers pain and discomfort from a bullet_wound he received years ago while working on the seattle police_force
like most characters on frasier daphne has many eccentricities she often tells rambling stories about her family cheerfully remembering rather grim or traumatic events to the considerable discomfort of the crane family she is also a firm_believer in the supernatural and believes herself to be a bit psychic daphnes apparent psychic abilities are often treated with ambiguity on the show and her various visions are sometimes shown to have come true sometimes in a roundabout way and sometimes very accurately on the other hand for the first seven seasons of the series the supposedly psychic daphne never suspects niles passionate infatuation with her which is painfully evident to all the other main characters indeed she only finally learns of this when frasier in a tranquilized drowsy state tells her outright as the series progressed daphnes psychic abilities were considerably down_played
daphnes most significant developing relationship over the course of the series is with frasier cranes younger brother niles crane unbeknownst to daphne niles falls_in love with her in the third episode when they first meet despite the increasing obviousness of niles infatuation daphne remains utterly oblivious to niles feelings towards her though they become increasingly close_friends niles says nothing to daphne at first because he is married later because she is involved with numerous frequently unsuccessful relationships with other men even when she is not frasier has one excuse or another to prevent niles from telling her anything
niles feelings are ultimately and accidentally revealed by frasier in season shocked to discover niles true feelings towards her daphne finds herself falling_in_love with niles in return placing her in the position niles had been in for many years in love with someone unaware of her true feelings
heartbroken to discover that he had on impulse married his girlfriend mel daphne intends to go ahead with her own marriage to niles divorce_lawyer donny until frasier intervenes in a four part episode closing season and opening season niles finally confesses his feelings to her and although she initially tells him both of them are_better_off staying with their current partnerseach having made_a_serious_commitment daphne changes_her_mind by the next morning abandoning donny at the altar to niles euphoria 
the guilt_she_suffers as a result and the difficulties in daphne and niles new relationship cause daphne to begin overeating a previous episode established her as eating junk_food when upset causing her family to believe shes pregnant she gains sixty pounds stone pounds but niles is so blinded by love he doesnt notice until daphne falls to the floor and is too heavy to get up without the help of frasier niles and martin who remarks it took three cranes to lift you the weight_problem was written into the show to allow leeves to continue working while pregnant daphne then left for several weeks to attend fat camp and returned with her figure restored during the episode it takes two to tangle in which she did not appear while at the resort niles tells roz that daphne had lost pounds ounces the weight of leeves baby in real_life
at some point in season she becomes a us citizen in the first episode of season daphne and niles marry in a small private ceremony in reno nevada the rest of season and early season show daphne and niles adjusting to their new life as a wedded couple daphne and niles have their first child david in the final episode of the series goodnight seattle he is named after the shows co creator david angell who died in the september attacks
she initially drives a small ford based on the uk focus which she uses to take the family to the burial_plots which martin purchases for frasier and niles in the episode where her room is violated by the family frasier is forced into buying her a ford mustang convertible we later see this vehicle in the episode where martin is looking for replacement_shoes when she marries niles she clearly ends up benefiting from his wealth too she drives a bmw x which is amusing considering niles fondness of mercedes
daphne grew up in a very large dysfunctional family they are often the subject of her long winded tales that sometimes leave the cranes somewhat perplexed although frequently mentioned the first time one of her family_members appears on the show is in the season episode dark side of the moon in which donny surprises daphne with a visit from her brother simon anthony lapaglia not knowing that she dislikes him her favorite brother stephen never appears until the final episode where he is played by richard e grant in something borrowed someone blue daphnes mother makes_her_first_appearance while her father only makes_his_debut in season 
on one episode she mentions she had an ancestor who served on the hms bounty who took fletcher christians side in the mutiny according to her he made it to pitcairn island with a tahitian wife and had several children when she mentioned to niles that there may be polynesian version of her on the island he nearly fainted as the image entered his mind
five out of daphnes eight brothers have appeared on the show unfortunately few of them maintained_consistency with daphnes northern accent lapaglia an australian actor faked a cockney london accent while robbie coltrane who is scottish played daphnes brother michael with a muddled brummy birmingham accent most of the brothers are portrayed as lawless alcoholic neer do wells and womanizers except for billy who is implied to be gay such as in the episode daphnes room in which daphne said all of my brothers would peek at me in the shower all of them except for billy that is when daphne talks with her mom gertrude about resuming her sex_life with niles after his heart_surgery gertrude tells her to use your feminine wiles thats how your brother billy landed kevin according to daphne billy rejected the familys traditional fishing_background by announcing that he hated the smell of fish and was going to teach ballroom_dancing daphne also has an uncle who lives in san francisco and who is said to be both a priest and a transvestite 
david mixner born august is a civil_rights_activist and best selling author he is best_known for his work in anti war and gay_rights_advocacy 
david benjamin mixner was born on august near the town of elmer in southern new jersey his father ben worked on a corporate_farm and his mother mary worked shifts at a local glass_factory and later took_a_job as a bookkeeper for the local john deere dealership david has two older siblings patsy mixner annison and melvin mixner 
mixner attended daretown elementary school then woodstown high_school where he got involved in the civil_rights_movement by participating in picketing and sending his own money to martin luther king jr in his bestselling memoir stranger among friends mixner explains that his parents were livid over his involvement in the civil_rights_movement claiming his activism embarrassed them when mixner told them he wanted to go south during the summer of after following the events in birmingham alabama his parents forbade him
in the fall of mixner enrolled at arizona state university in tempe arizona where he soon became heavily involved in civil_rights and anti war activism including helping to organize protests against a speech by general william westmoreland prompted by an article he read in the arizona republic about city_garbage_workers who were seeking the right to unionize in the fall of mixner organized from start to finish the first of many protests he would organize over the next thirty years mixner rallied hundreds of workers students and professors and led a march on city hall although the city successfully broke_the_strike the workers eventually earned the right to unionize 
mixner also experienced his first same sex relationship at asu with a man whom he refers to as kit in his memoirs a year into their relationship kit was killed in an automobile_accident mixner did not attend the funeral and kits parents never discovered that their son was gay 
soon after kits death mixner decided to transfer to the university of maryland in order to be closer to washington dc where he would be able to get more involved in anti war protests
mixner found himself much more interested in activism than in pursuing a college_degree while at maryland mixner was a grassroots_organizer for the march on the pentagon which was later captured in norman mailers armies of the night
later that year mixner dropped out of college and began working for the presidential_campaign of eugene mccarthy one of mixners first assignments was organizing the minnesota operation helping mccarthy win the minnesota caucus defeating incumbent president lyndon b johnson later mixner and other members of mccarthys campaign_team went to georgia to help select an alternative delegation to send to the national convention in chicago challenging governor lestor maddoxs hand picked delegation which included only seven african_americans in the person delegation the georgia democratic party forum which sought to challenge maddoxs delegation held_its_own_convention in macon where congressman john conyers dmi keynoted their convention before turning over the floor to julian bond the first african_american elected to the georgia legislature who would later become chairman of the naacp
at the democratic national convention in chicago mixner was beaten by police during the protests_held outside the convention_center after humphrey claimed the nomination mixner began seeking out new outlets for his activism he soon befriended doris kearns goodwin who introduced mixner to senator ted kennedy who would become a lifelong friend
in early mixner was invited to join the delegate selection committee which had been created during the democratic national convention although mixners appointment turned out to be a mistake as senator fred r harris of oklahoma was supposed to invite mixner to join the less powerful rules committee he nonetheless made_his_mark on the twenty eight member body which included warren christopher who would later become secretary_of_state_senator birch bayh of indiana senator harold hughes of iowa senator adlai stevenson iii of illinois and senator george mcgovern of south dakota who served as the committees chairman
by virtue of his inadvertent inclusion on the delegate selection committee mixner served as his generations lone_voice and he intended the use the platform to raise_the_issue of the violence at the previous years convention when senator kennedy a close_friend of chicago mayor richard j daley and the partys front runner for the presidential_nomination took_the_witness_stand mixner used the opportunity to ask kennedy if he would publicly condemn both the tactics used by the chicago police and the mayor for his involvement kennedy dodged the question subsequently adlai stevenson iii sought to exclude mixner from a committee_meeting in chicago where mayor daley was scheduled to testify mcgovern called mixner asking him not to attend but mixner refused when he arrived for the meeting drawing_the_ire of senator stevenson mcgovern offered him a compromise promising to ask daley to apologize for the violence and offer all those arrested amnesty if mixner agreed to stay quiet the resulting exchange between mcgovern and daley included daleys insistence that if people violate the law they should accept the consequences of the law 
the mcgovern commission which had set out to reform the presidential_nomination_process in order to avoid a repeat of the convention eventually issued its recommendations including the requirement that all delegates be directly elected by the people eviscerating the power of political bosses to control the nomination_process 
mixners most significant contribution to the anti vietnam war effort was his role as one of the head_organizers of the moratorium to end the war in vietnam the idea was prompted by jerome grossman a massachusetts businessman active in the peace_movement grossman proposed to sam brown a close_friend of mixner that they set aside a day in where business as usual would come_to_a_halt essentially engaging in a strike against everything brown decided that the word moratorium would be less threatening than strike to middle class americans and set to work setting aside october as the day of the moratorium brown soon enlisted the help of mixner david hawk another young activist and marge sklencar who they knew from the mccarthy campaign brown mixner hawk and sklencar then set about organizing the event
in september shortly before the moratorium mixner headed to marthas vineyard to meet with fellow_activists many of whom had also worked on the mccarthy campaign among those in attendance was bill clinton who had been invited by one of mixners friends at the time clinton was studying at oxford on a rhodes scholarship attending the marthas vineyard retreat with fellow rhodes scholars rick stearns and strobe talbott mixner and clinton were fast friends and mixner would play_a_significant_role twenty three years later in getting the lgbt community to support clinton 
as the date of the moratorium approached it began gathering a great deal of momentum with time life and newsweek magazines featuring it in cover_stories when clinton subsequently visited the headquarters of the moratorium and saw what he would be missing by being in london on october he suggested to mixner that he organize a parallel protest at oxford this protest in which about a thousand people gathered in front of the american embassy in london would later be a significant issue in his presidential_campaign with president george h bush telling larry king on cnn in october maybe im old fashioned but to go to a foreign country and demonstrate against your own country when your sons and daughters are dying halfway around the world i am sorry but i think that is wrong
the moratorium drew millions of people throughout the country who gathered in public_places and read the names of the soldiers killed in vietnam aloud the day was capped off by a march at the washington monument where coretta scott king the widow of martin luther king jr spoke about her late husbands passion for ending the war
in mixner began the process of coming_out_of_the_closet and soon thereafter was a founding_member of the municipal elections committee of los angeles mecla the nations first gay and lesbian political action committee at the time very few candidates were willing to accept donations from openly gay individuals or gay affiliated organizations at the time mixner was also serving as the campaign_manager for tom bradley the mayor of los angeles who was seeking reelection so while he worked to raise_funds for mecla his involvement was kept_secret because of the potential for his sexuality to become an issue in bradleys campaign
soon after bradley won_reelection easily mixner turned_his_focus to fighting proposition an initiative placed on the california ballot by orange county state_senator john briggs that would make it illegal for gays and lesbians to be schoolteachers similar initiatives had recently passed throughout the country when mixner turned_his_focus to fighting proposition creating the no on organization to fight it through the process he would publicly come_out_of_the_closet mixner and his lover peter scott secured a meeting with then governor ronald reagan whom they convinced to oppose the initiative publicly as a result and through the work of mixner scott legendary gay_rights_activist and san francisco city councilman harvey milk and others proposition was defeated by over a million votes the first ballot_initiative of its sort to be shot down 
as a result of this huge success mixner and scott experienced a huge upturn in business for their fledgling political_consulting_firm mixnerscott and were asked by bill clinton then running for governor of arkansas to host_a_reception for clinton at their los angeles home
in late after years of devastation in his personal_life resulting from the aids_crisis mixner decided to focus his energy on combating nuclear_proliferation creating an organization named pro peace mixner envisioned finding five thousand americans who would take a year out of their lives to walk across america to advocate for disarmament holding_rallies throughout the country 
the great peace march for global nuclear disarmament which mixner would later call his biggest political failure and his biggest regret ultimately left los angeles on march with only marchers mixner would spend many years paying the consequences which included fighting lawsuits and paying employment_taxes for his employees the lore of the march lives on however immortalized in songs books and film
shortly after mixner experienced professional success in helping defeat proposition a ballot_initiative proposed by lyndon larouche that would require quarantining people with aids mixner learned that his long time lover and business_partner peter scott had aids scott would fight the disease for four years he died on may while scott fought the disease mixner formed an organization that spearheaded legislation that would create a california alternative to the fda enabling california to deal more aggressively with the aids_epidemic than the federal_government mixners group enlisted the support of california attorney_general john van de kamp then convinced governor george deukmejian to sign ab which as described by van de kamp mandates the director of dhs to implement the drug_testing and sale_authority that he had under existing law for the purpose of approving the testing and sale either of an aids_vaccine or of new drugs that offer_a_reasonable_possibility of treating people who have been infected with the aids_virus 
four years after a fundraiser for the dukakis campaign told mixner that governor dukakis would not accept the million dollars mixner and his friends planned to raise for him mixner found hope in the candidacy of his old friend bill clinton after clinton promised mixner that he would support both an end to the ban on gays in the military and increased funds to find a cure for aids mixner began raising money for clinton enthusiastically mickey kantor clintons campaign_chairman soon asked mixner to join the national executive committee of the clinton for president campaign the first openly gay person to become a public face of a presidential_campaign 
after clinton was elected mixner helped with the transition_team though he publicly declared that he would not seek an appointment with the new administration although he spoke at an event at the inaugural_ball introduced by his old friend ted kennedy mixner soon thrust himself in the middle of the furor over the dont ask dont tell policy proposed by clinton which represented a total betrayal to mixner and many in the gay_community 
when mixner went on nightline to complain about clintons rapid shift away from allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military his calls to the white house stopped being returned and his consulting_business began to tank as he was no longer perceived as someone who had_influence with the new administration 
shortly thereafter mixner participated in a march in washington for the campaign for military service which advocated lifting the bans on gays in the military when clinton announced the dont ask dont tell policy on july mixner organized a march with cms and was very publicly arrested outside the white house for which he received a great deal of publicity because of his personal relationship with clinton mixner and clinton later healed the rift but clinton never again revisited the policy during his presidency

the socialist administration of bolivian president evo morales has not always had_a_good_relationship with the bolivian hierarchy of the roman_catholic church this has become a problem for morales as polls_taken in the early s indicate that of the bolivian population say they are catholic meaning that about seven million of the nine million bolivians follow the roman_catholic faith when faced with a morales policy that they disagree with catholic bishops of bolivia are able to inspire large demonstrations against the measures the catholic church draws_most_of_its_support from the cities and little from the higher rural_areas where morales draws_his_main_support due to a lack of resources and to indigenous cultural resistance to church efforts to replace traditional attitudes morales has stated that he is a catholic he like many rural bolivians was raised with a combination of catholicism and belief in the pachamama or mother earth figure as well as on ekeko a traditional indigenous god of luck harvests and general abundance other indigenous leaders like felix patzi see below follow_a_pure_indigenous_faith and discard all forms of christianity however this effort has not led to a significant increase in the number of indigenous belief only worshippers
the special place given to catholicism in bolivia can be seen in article of the bolivian constitution which says the state recognizes and sustains the catholic apostolic and roman religion it guarantees the public exercise of all other faiths relations with the catholic church shall be governed by concordats and agreements between the bolivian state and the holy see the united states state department has characterized this as the constitution recognizes it catholicism as the official religion a statement that the comments of bolivian bishops see below would seem to disagree with
on june the archbishop of santa cruz de la sierra cardinal julio terrazas addressed the rumors that congressional_candidates to the bolivian parliament were saying that the catholic church was demanding to be made the official religion of bolivia in his sunday sermon the cardinal assured people that they were not seeking or fighting to achieve such a goal he pointed out that the bishops had until recently been open to reviewing the bolivian constitutions article that granted special recognition to the role of catholicism the cardinal said they keep saying we are fighting for that article not so let it be reviewed but let it be done intelligently and fully lets not deny that this country has truly received the seeds of the kingdom of justice and of truth that the lord has brought and that that has been part of her history and that is why in so many parts of bolivia we are proud to be catholics the cardinal pointed out that catholicism had stopped being the official state_religion of bolivia since and said the church is merely asking for respect and recognition of the work she has done he said those who are calling for secularism are hiding their other intentions to strip bolivia of religion and order a country in such a way that god is not present
in early june the socialist_party of evo morales movimiento al socialismo seized lands adjacent to a marian shrine in copacabana these lands where originally given to the shrine decades ago by the bolivian government so that income derived by use of the land would help support the shrine at the seizure party_loyalists declared that they were taking only the unproductive lands of the church and the land was divided into seven lots and several trees were cut down father obermaier in charge of the shrine called for the government to resolve the situation
on july while the education_reform_controversy was ongoing see below the socialist senator antonio peredo joined with other members of morales movimiento al socialismo in the bolivian parliament to call for an end of recognizing catholic feast_days such as corpus christi and all saints day as national_holidays the suggested policy was to only recognize holy week and christmas for the nationally recognized holidays to change the policy would have to be approved by the full parliament
in early june bolivian education_minister felix patzi working under president evo morales declared that education will emphatically be secular and no longer catholic religion_classes will now be optional instead of obligatory there will be a course on the history of religions indigenous arabic or catholic the reform called for secular_education that respects the beliefs the spirituality of indigenous and native nations and of the bolivian nations as the basis of individual and communitarian_rights the bolivian roman_catholic hierarchy immediately opposed this proposal and saw it as an attack on religion in bolivia they were outspoken against the measure and organized protests against it
in june minister felix patzi a sociologist of aymara indian descent who practices a pre columbian religion that worships the earth goddess brought organizational opposition against the morales governments ideas when he declared that catholicism would no longer be the official religion taught at schools patzis said that he wanted to end the the religious monopoly of the catholic faith in schools and allow all faith to be taught from oriental religions to those practiced by our native peoples he said he would end the policy that makes catholic religious_classes obligatory for students and called the existing system colonial in an interview with the newspaper la razon patzi said in bolivia the people are not only catholic but also of other religious_faiths he stated his fear of the issue leading to confrontation among bolivians
after protests by the catholic hierarchy patzi clarified that the sectarian roman_catholic classes taught in state_schools would be replaced with a history of religions class that would include a focus on traditional indigenous beliefs alongside catholicism and other faiths practiced in bolivia patzi said that catholicism would no longer be the official religion of the countrys educational_system the morales governments announced its policy as a call for secular_education that respects the beliefs the spirituality of indigenous and native nations and of the bolivian nations as the basis of individual and communitarian_rights it was announced that the proposal would come before the national assembly for a vote on august 
immediately after patzis statements archbishop tito solari of cochabamba said the morales government must be consistent when it talks about respecting beliefs which implies respecting the catholic beliefs of the majority of bolivians he defended the existence of covenant_schools which are administered by the hierarchy of the catholic church but are paid for by bolivian taxes drawn from both catholics and non catholics alike solari said parents are the first and foremost educators of their children therefore they have the right to choose the kind of education they want families are very appreciative of the schools that are administered by the church which serve the community and in a special way those in need he defined what he thought was the proper role of the government saying the state and the institutions of civil_society can contribute in a democratic atmosphere to people choosing the best educational model for the integral and critical formation of persons
in mid june a spokeswoman for the bolivian bishops committee on education demanded that the morales government clarify its position on religious_instruction in state_schools she said we are anxious not out of fear but out of concern that the government define its position in order to begin dialogue she took_issue with patzi labeling the current system as colonialist saying he is ignoring the churchs contribution to culture education health_care and development in bolivia she pointed out that the church respects other beliefs and is not asking for catholicism to be forced upon the people she accused the socialist morales government of having an anti faith bias i think the problem is not with the church but with the faith of the people who are catholic
responding to patzis comments the archbishop of santa cruz cardinal julio terrazas sandoval called for bolivian catholics to defend their faith he also_called on president morales to note the difference between a lay_state and a secular_state that is hostile to religions the catholic church will defend the universal right to profess a religion this is unrenounceable and non negotiable this is the basis for helping to form a family that is much more united in the cause of the kingdom of justice and peace and to build a country that is not in constant turmoil bishop jesus juarez of el alto accused the morales government of using double speak in its educational_policies after the bishops statements morales stressed that religion courses would not be eliminated from public_schools
in july in sucre bolivia during a meeting of the national educational congress delegates from the bishops conference of bolivia walked out claiming it had become political and exclusive the government is seeking to impose its new education_law which reflects an attitude that prevents dialogue about certain aspects of the future of education in bolivia education_minister felix patzi spoke with several bishops in a late night meeting and pledged to uphold religious_instruction in schools and respect the church state agreement saying we recognize the contribution of the church in the area of education technical_formation and other areas religious_subject_matter will respect the diversity of religions and that is something we share with the church everyone has the right to practice the diversity of other religions there was never any disagreement on that bishop jesus juarez of el alto who together with auxiliary_bishop luis sainz of cochabomba said that not only do parochial_schools have a fundamental_right to offer instruction according to their own confession but that in state_schools the parents should be able to choose which type of religious_instruction their children will receive bishop sainz demanded the morales government clarify and come up with a consensus about the concept of secular_education so that there are no longer any doubts at the end of its conference the national educational congress led by patzi approved a resolution saying education in bolivia is secular and pluralistic because it respects the spirituality of each culture and freedom of belief it promotes its own values and rejects every type of dogmatisms they called for the curricula to be adapted in accord with the diverse beliefs of the country while before patzi had stated that the policy would only go_into_effect after its consideration by the bolivian parliament after the educational congress approved the measure he declared that its conclusions were binding and would be implemented immediately this drew_another_wave_of_protests from bolivian catholics who demanded patzis resignation

heavy weather was a dramatisation for television by douglas livingstone of the novel heavy weather by p g wodehouse set at blandings castle it was made by the bbc and wgbh boston first screened by the bbc on christmas eve and shown in the united states on pbss masterpiece theatre on february 
though abridged for a minute film heavy weather followed closely the novel of the fourth in the blandings series many of the familiar elements of the blandings books were present the wish of lord emsworths nephew ronnie fish to marry a chorus_girl sue brown the concern of emsworths sisters the imperious lady constance keeble and ronnies mother lady julia fish to ensure that the reminiscences of their other brother the hon galahad threepwood were not published galahads protectiveness towards miss brown the daughter of his long lost love dolly henderson the sustained efforts of the publisher lord tilbury a character probably based on lord northcliffe to gain_possession of the reminiscences lord emsworths determination that his prize berkshire pig the empress of blandings should win the silver_medal in the fat_pigs_class at the shrewsbury agricultural_show lord emsworths employment of a private detective p frobisher pilbeam to protect the empress and his rivalry with his neighbour sir gregory parsloe of matchingham hall who had not only his own designs on the fat_pigs_class but as a prospective parliamentary_candidate an interest in suppressing galahads reminiscences and the employment as lord emsworths secretary of monty bodkin who as with most holders of that office had an ulterior motive in this instance the need to hold down paid employment for a year in order to be considered suitable to marry one gertrude butterwick
heavy weather had a distinguished cast peter otoole as clarence lord emsworth richard briers as galahad threepwood judy parfitt as lady constance sarah badel as lady julia roy hudd as beach the butler ronald fraser as sir gregory parsloe and richard johnson as lord tilbury the recently ennobled george stinker pyke pilbeam was played by david bamber who became widely_known around the same time as mr collins in the bbcs adaptation of jane austens pride and prejudice other members of the cast included rebecca lacey as sue brown benjamin soames as ronnie fish and samuel west as monty bodkin
the screenplay was written by douglas livingstone born the director was jack gold and the producers verity lambert and david shanks
there were many devotees of wodehouse who assumed at the time that heavy weather was in effect a pilot for a series of blandings adaptations as such this would have complemented the four series of jeeves and wooster granada stories derived from wodehouse that featured rising_stars stephen fry as jeeves and hugh laurie as bertie wooster however not only did no series follow but heavy weather has never been repeated on british television it was however released on video vhs by acorn media in a dvd_release is yet to appear
this alone tended to set it apart from the array of successful dramas set in the second and early third quarters of the th century that had were shown on british television in the s and early s in addition to jeeves and wooster these included definitive adaptations from onwards of agatha christies miss marple and poirot stories with joan hickson and david suchet in the leading_roles other detective_stories such as christies the seven dials mystery lwt featuring cheryl campbell as a neo wodehousian flapper lady bundle brent and margery allinghams about albert campion bbc the house of elliot bbc with louise lombard and stella gonet as struggling couturiers in the s and two series lwt based on e f bensons mapp and lucia novels that although described by one leading critic as nicely realised if appealing more to the fans of the six novels than to the audience in general were nevertheless repeated several times over the following twenty years and released in both vhs and dvd formats
in fact as film_historian leslie halliwell noted wodehouses sagas of upper_class_twits and manservants in the twenties have been oddly neglected by the screen though they were much imitated however there were two films made in the s with arthur treacher as jeeves thank you jeeves in which also featured david niven as wooster and step lively jeeves in and in a damsel in distress virtually a blandings novel but with different characters was turned by rko into a musical_film scored by george gershwin that starred fred astaire and joan fontaine
an adaptation by c e webber of a wodehouse short_story of was broadcast on bbc childrens television in march as lord emsworth and the little friend then in the s the bbc made a popular series called the world of wooster featuring dennis price as jeeves and ian carmichael as a rather middle_aged bertie wooster wodehouse himself much preferred prices performance this led to among other spin offs a series of blandings castle with sir ralph richardson as lord emsworth meriel forbes as lady constance stanley holloway as beach derek nimmo as galahad threepwood and as one wodehouse scholar acutely observed a wessex saddleback rather than a berkshire as the empress of blandings 
between there were several bbc radio_adaptations of blandings in which richard vernon as lord emsworth conveyed a mix of eccentricity and amiability his delivery being quite similar to that in his occasional role in yes minister and yes prime_minister bbc tv as the befuddled city banker sir desmond glazebrook ian carmichael played galahad in a number of these productions in random house audiobooks released an abridged version of heavy weather read by martin jarvis
in heavy weather became the only visual feature length version of blandings since the second world war closer to the original novel than most other adaptations of wodehouse some may have found peter otooles emsworth a little too eccentric and irascible while the touches of realism such as quantities of pig swill which tended not to intrude into earlier wodehouse productions conceivably detracted from the cosy air of fantasy but even so the lack of any follow up to such a major enterprise seemed puzzling to many
like the adaptations of bensons mapp and lucia heavy weather probably appealed more to fans of wodehouse than to a wider audience a serious consideration for a programme broadcast at peak_viewing_time on christmas eve it is possible too that by the mid s the publics appetite for dramas of the s and s was beginning to wane a genre that was coming strongly back into vogue at the time was the large_scale_adaptation of the classic novel this was typified by the bbcs pride and prejudice with colin firth as darcy and jennifer ehle as elizabeth bennet ehle having come_to_public_attention as the vampish calypso in the camomile lawn channel s dramatisation of mary wesleys novel which opened on the eve of war in but there were also feature_films of other jane austen novels such as sense and sensibility with emma thompson kate winslet and hugh grant and emma a film with gwyneth paltrow in the title_role and a tv_version with kate beckinsale both a further landmark was the film four weddings and a funeral starring hugh grant this was a highly successful light_comedy in the tradition of the ealing films of the late s and early s but clearly rooted in the present day and with some of its vernacular_language rather than looking to the past
the mid s were a period of transition in british popular_culture and arguably in the country more generally although in the prime_minister john major had made a widely quoted almost betjeman eque assertion that fifty years on from now britain will still be the country of long shadows on county_cricket_grounds warm beer and as george orwell said old maids bicycling to holy_communion this seemed to some a rather sentimental and complacent view by britpop was at its height in certain respects mirroring the impact of the beatles thirty years earlier and about to be caught up or subsumed in the concept of cool britannia would see the rise of so_called girl_power notably for a time in the pervasive guise of the spice girls the sweeping election_victory in may of tony blair and his new labour party and a few months later the death of diana princess of wales the mawkish public reaction to which was thought by many at the time to have changed britain for ever
although as evelyn waugh once said mr wodehouses idyllic word can never stale he has made a world for us to live in and delight in the circumstances of britain towards at the end of the th century probably did not bode well for a sustained revival of blandings for example in the next few years the continuing adaptations of poirot became a little darker in tone and dispensed with many of the lighter elements of the earlier episodes such as poirots associate captain hastings who had many wodehousian characteristics and like conan doyles dr watson was unable to keep his cognition uncontaminated by his all too human emotions and motives in the film gosford park a murder_mystery set in which harked back to the deep focus of jean renoirs film la rgle du jeu firmly established a trend away from the nostalgic lavish period_recreations of which heavy weather was one of the last that had been prevalent since the late s
even so a sign of wodehouses sustained influence was the establishment as the internet began to take_hold in the mid s of a search_engine called ask jeeves this title survived until shortened to ask in the following year when it was reported that the british prime_minister wished to employ a butler in fact a house_manager the mail on sunday referred to mr blairs very own st century jeeves 
heavy weather was filmed at sudeley castle gloucestershire which was widely though not universally regarded as wodehouses model for blandings wodehouse set blandings in the more northerly county of shropshire a location that stimulated some intriguing research by richard usborne a leading wodehouse scholar into train_journeys of which there were two in heavy weather between londons paddington station and market blandings 
sudeley was the home during her marriage to thomas seymour of queen katherine parr sixth wife of king henry viii katherine died in and is buried in the chapel at sudeley the castle has been owned since by the dent brocklehurst family in it passed on the death of his father to henry dent brocklehurst born whose mother later lady ashcombe initially held sudeley in trust and by the mid s had done much to develop its potential for tourism and business 
the location of heavy weather at sudeley assisted public awareness of the castle and its grounds sudeleys promotional literature emphasised the wodehouse connection noting for example that the double yew_hedges in the queens garden were the inspiration for the gardens of blandings

the holtzman_effect is a fictional scientific phenomenon in the dune universe created by frank herbert beginning with the novel dune the effect is never explained in detail but it makes among other things defensive_force_shields and instantaneous space_travel possible
frank herbert was inconsistent with the spelling of holtzman resulting in the variant spellings holtzmann s children of dune and holzmann s chapterhouse dune this is likely intentional as herbert mutated other words and names over the several millennia the dune series spans such as the change of arrakis to rakis and caladan to dan beginning with heretics of dune 
according to the legends of dune prequel_trilogy by brian herbert and kevin j anderson the holtzman_effect is named after the scientist who discovered it tio holtzman though for many of its applications holtzman in fact takes_credit for the mathematical theories of his assistant norma cenva
in terminology of the imperium the glossary of the novel dune frank herbert provides the following definition
in dune the technology has been adapted for reliable use in personal defensive shields these shields unlike many others in science_fiction are not round projections of force but form fitting energy_fields which permit penetration only by objects that move below a pre set velocity paul atreides notes in dune in shield_fighting one moves fast on defense slow on attack attack has the sole purpose of tricking the opponent into a misstep setting him up for the attack sinister the shield turns the fast blow admits the slow kindjal
as one would be unable to breathe within a shield that did not permit atmospheric_gases to penetrate it man portable shields have a relatively high penetration_velocity approximately six to nine centimeters per second
the interaction of a lasgun_beam and a holtzman_field results in subatomic_fusion and a nuclear_explosion the magnitude of this blast is unpredictable sometimes it destroys only the shielded target and gunner sometimes the explosion is more powerful than atomics using lasguns in a shielded environment can result in military and environmental_catastrophe though at one point in dune duncan idaho deliberately allows shield lasgun contact as a discouragement to his enemies in god_emperor of dune the god_emperor leto ii notes years into his reign that shields are banned throughout the empire and it is a capital offense to possess one to avoid such explosive interactions
the vibrations of an active shield will drive a sandworm on arrakis into a killing frenzy drawing them from across territorial lines to attack the shield for this reason the native fremen eschew them it is noted in children of dune that the fremen have developed a small shield_generator known as a pseudo shield to attract and madden a worm for use as an ersatz_bomb
the effect is used in this case to fold space at the quantum_level allowing the spacing guilds heighliner_ships to instantaneously travel far distances across space however the chaotic and seemingly non deterministic quantum_nature of foldspace requires at least limited prescience on the part of the human navigator otherwise the absurdly complex mathematics involved in producing reliable physical projections of such events would only be possible with advanced thinking_machines which are strictly prohibited because of mankinds crusade against thinking_machines the butlerian jihad to this effect the guild produces melange saturated navigators who intuitively see paths through foldspace in this way this stumbling block is overcome several thousand years after the events of dune when ixian scientists develop mechanical replacements for guild navigators
hovering_devices called suspensors utilize the secondary low drain phase of a holtzman_field generator to nullify gravity within certain limits prescribed by relative mass and energy_consumption suspensors are used in chairs tables and structures that are too massive to be physically sound among many other obvious uses in dune the grotesquely obese baron vladimir harkonnen utilizes suspensor_belts and harnesses to buoy his flesh and allow him to walk in dune jessica theorizes that suspensors like shields attract sandworms and while some are seen in fremen sietch_communities none are active in the deep desert
a varied use of the holtzman_effect is the glowglobe this device is a small glowing sphere that floats gracefully above a surface like a portable personal sun since it is typically tuned to a yellowish color herberts description in the glossary of dune reads
the non canon dune encyclopedia by dr willis e mcnelly invents an extensive alternate origin and description of the holtzman_effect in this version it is discovered by ibrahim vaughn holtzman born bg
the son of the planetary_governor of liesco ii holtzman has a specialized ship constructed and escapes into space to think his mathematical genius is enhanced by the exponentially increased mental_processing made possible by his new computerized form which also allows him to exist for nearly years he focuses on analyzing the suspensor nullification effect which as frank herbert established makes interstellar_travel possible according to the encyclopedia this effect had been discovered years earlier but is not fully understood holtzmans first related discovery is an instantaneous interstellar communication_device later called the holtzman wave
until this point interstellar_travel had effected a widespread population of the universe which could no longer be controlled by the imperial house ceres the development of holtzman wave generators gives mankind the means to easily communicate across vast distances and results in the long and ferocious wars of reunification holtzman himself remains in seclusion returning to civilization five times on his third return over years after his original escape he gives humanity his next related discovery defensive shields on his fourth return millennia later holtzman published his unified theory linking the various effects into a single hierarchy of phenomena the last intelligent machine left in existence after the butlerian jihad he is apparently destroyed in bg knowing his ship is booby_trapped with a dormant laser aimed at a defensive shield the jihad fleet send a volunteer to board the ship thereby setting off the explosion which results from shield laser interaction
according to the encyclopedia the three dimensional suspensor nullification effect is discovered thousands of years before holtzman explored the associated phenomena his name is eventually applied to all manifestations of the holtzman_effect
the brian herbertkevin j anderson legends of dune prequel_trilogy establishes that the holtzman_effect is discovered by and named after scientist and inventor tio holtzman immediately prior to the butlerian jihad some years before the events of dune the technology is employed for defensive_force_fields capable of scrambling the gel circuitry of thinking_machines the force of sentient computers and robots who seek to enslave and exterminate mankind networks of towers generating the field from the surface protect entire planets from machine_attacks
residing on the planet poritrin holtzmans career is on_the_wane as he has not invented anything significant in several years he comes across the work of norma cenva a woman from rossak realizing her genius he invites her to come work with him on poritrin the machines soon realize that their cymeks human machine hybrids can slip though the planetary_force_fields to destroy the transmitters because they possess human brains which are unaffected by the scrambler_fields cenva has the idea to use the field as an offensive weapon projecting it with portable transmitters to knock out machines and their installations holtzman later calculates that the field can be modified to prevent penetration from physical projectiles cenva agrees correcting the flaws in his concept but noting that objects can still pass through the shield at a slow enough speed the human forces start installing these new shields on their battleships and most ground_forces however as it is still a new technology at the time the shields tend to overheat with too much use and deactivate as time passes holtzman discovers that the young dwarfish woman is much more creative than he and after being upstaged by her twice begins to dislike her eventually he takes_credit for cenvas mathematical theories which lead to many practical uses for holtzmans original discovery including the holtzman drive holtzman shields suspensors and glowglobes cenva is also credited with the realization that hitting a holtzman_field with a lasgun_beam results in a large and unpredictable explosion her theory is proven in the novel dune the machine crusade when holtzman himself is killed by the explosion from such an interaction during a slave_uprising on poritrin
the legends of dune series also establishes that cenva invents the theory of space folding in bg during the butlerian jihad after years of working on holtzmans original field_equations by bg she had built a prototype space folding ship and soon she and industrialist aurelius venport establish a shipyard on the planet kolhar to produce what would eventually be called heighliners within a decade venport puts the space folding technology and shipyards at the disposal of the jihad forces initially foldspace_travel is not completely accurate or safe only about nine out of every ten heighliners make it to their final destination realizing that the spice_melange amplifies her psychic and calculative abilities norma pioneers the use of massive concentrated doses to presciently perceive spacetime in bg she discovers that this is the way to safely navigate foldspace and essentially becomes the first navigator that same year normas son adrien venport founds the foldspace shipping company which later becomes the spacing guild and eventually monopolizes space_commerce transport and interplanetary_banking cenvas name is eventually forgotten by history but she is more interested in improving defensive shields and developing foldspace_travel to make it safer and more efficient her efforts help humanity defeat the thinking_machines
in s dune house atreides the first novel of the prelude to dune prequel_trilogy by brian herbert and anderson the following is stated via epigraph

hunter stockton thompson july february was an american journalist and author most famous for his roman_a_clef fear and loathing in las vegas he is credited as the creator of gonzo_journalism a style of reporting where reporters involve themselves in the action to such a degree that they become central_figures of their stories he was also known for his use of psychedelics alcohol firearms and his iconoclastic contempt for authoritarianism
hunter stockton thompson was born in louisville kentucky the first of three sons to jack robert thompson july an insurance_adjuster and a world war i veteran and virginia davidson ne ray a reference_librarian his parents met after being introduced by a mutual friend from jacks fraternity in and married in 
the thompson family resided in the cherokee triangle neighborhood of the highlands in louisville jack thompson died of myasthenia_gravis a neuromuscular disease on july when hunter was years old leaving three sonshunter davison and james february march to be brought up by their mother contemporaries indicated that after jacks death virginia became a heavy_drinker
interested in sports and athletically inclined from a young age thompson joined louisvilles castlewood athletic club a sports_club for teenagers that prepared them for high_school sports where he excelled in baseball though he never joined any sports_teams in high_school where he was constantly in trouble
thompson attended the in bloom elementary school and then highland middle school then atherton high_school transferring to louisville male high_school in following the death of his father that same year he was accepted as a member of the athenaeum literary association a school sponsored literary and social_club that had been founded at male high in its members at the time generally drawn from louisvilles wealthy upper class families included porter bibb who became the first publisher of rolling stone
as an athenaeum member thompson contributed articles and helped edit the clubs yearbook the spectator however the group ejected thompson from its membership in citing his legal problems charged as an accessory to robbery after having been in a car with the person who committed_the_robbery thompson was sentenced to serve days in kentuckys jefferson county jail he served days of his sentence and joined the us air_force a week after his release
thompson did_his_basic_training at lackland air_force base in san antonio texas and later transferred to scott air_force base in illinois to study electronics he applied to become a pilot but was rejected by the air_forces aviation cadet program in he transferred to eglin air_force base near pensacola florida there he worked in the information_services department and became the sports_editor of the bases newspaper the command courier in this capacity he covered the eglin eagles a base football_team that included such future professional stars as max mcgee and zeke bratkowski thompson traveled with the team around the us covering its games in he also wrote a sports_column anonymously for the playground news a local newspaper in fort walton beach florida
thompson left the air_force in as an airman first class having been recommended for an early honorable discharge by his commanding_officer in summary this airman although talented will not be guided by policy col william s evans chief of information_services wrote to the eglin personnel_office sometimes his rebel and superior attitude seems to rub off on other airmen_staff_members thompson claimed in a mock press_release he wrote about the end of his duty to have been issued a totally unclassifiable status
after the air_force he worked as sports_editor for a newspaper in jersey shore pennsylvania before moving to new york city there he attended columbia universitys school of general studies part time on the gi bill taking_classes in short_story writing
thompsons friends and letters from this period note he was an avid reader of the beat generation during his early years as a writer and that he associated himself with the beat_culture while living in new york city he would later befriend such beat authors as allen ginsberg and william s burroughs
during this time he worked briefly for time as a copy_boy for a week while working he used a typewriter to copy f scott fitzgeralds the great gatsby and ernest hemingways a farewell to arms in order to learn about the writing_styles of the authors in time fired him for insubordination later that year he worked as a reporter for the middletown daily record in middletown new york he was fired from this job after damaging an office_candy_machine and arguing with the owner of a local restaurant who happened to be an advertiser with the paper
in thompson moved to san juan puerto rico to take_a_job with the sporting_magazine el sportivo which soon folded after his arrival thompson had first applied for a job with the puerto rico english language daily the san juan star but its managing_editor future novelist william j kennedy declined thompsons request nonetheless the two became friends and after the demise of el sportivo thompson worked as a stringer for the new york herald tribune and a few stateside_papers on caribbean issues with kennedy working as his editor after returning to the states hunter lived in california working as a security_guard and caretaker at the big sur hot_springs for an eight month period in just before it became the esalen institute while there he was able to publish his first magazine_feature in the nationally distributed rogue magazine on the artisan and bohemian culture of big sur the unwanted publicity generated from the article got him fired from his job as a caretaker
during this period thompson wrote two novels prince jellyfish and the rum diary and submitted many short_stories to publishers with little success the rum diary which fictionalized thompsons experiences in puerto rico was eventually published in long after thompson had become famous
from may to may thompson traveled to south america as a correspondent for a dow jones owned weekly newspaper the national observer in brazil he spent several months working also as a reporter on the brazil herald the countrys only english language daily published in rio de janeiro his longtime girlfriend sandra dawn conklin aka sandy conklin thompson now sondi wright later joined him in rio
thompson and conklin were married on may shortly after they returned to the united states they briefly relocated to aspen colorado and had one son juan fitzgerald thompson born march the couple conceived five more times together three of the pregnancies were miscarried and the other two pregnancies produced infants who died shortly after birth hunter and sandy divorced in but remained close_friends until thompsons death
in the thompson family then moved to glen ellen california where thompson continued to write for the national observer on an array of domestic_subjects including a story about his visit to ketchum idaho in order to investigate the reasons for ernest hemingways suicide while working on the story thompson symbolically stole a pair of elk_antlers hanging above the front door of hemingways cabin thompson and the editors at the observer eventually had_a_falling_out after the paper refused to print thompsons review of tom wolfes essay_collection the kandy kolored tangerine flake streamline baby and he moved to san francisco immersing himself in the drug and hippie_culture that was taking_root in the area about this time he began writing for the berkeley underground_paper the spyder
in carey mcwilliams editor of the nation offered thompson the opportunity to write a story based on his experience with the california based hells angels motorcycle_gang after the nation published the article may thompson received several book_offers and spent the next year living and riding with the hells angels the relationship broke down when the bikers suspected that thompson was only friends with them so he could make_money from his writing the gang demanded a share of the profits and after an argument at a party thompson ended up with a savage beating or stomping as the angels referred to it random house published the hard_cover hells angels the strange and terrible saga of the outlaw motorcycle_gangs in a reviewer for the new york times praised it as an angry knowledgeable fascinating and excitedly_written book that shows the hells angels not so much as dropouts from society but as total misfits or unfits emotionally intellectually and educationally unfit to achieve the rewards such as they are that the contemporary social_order offers the reviewer also praised thompson as a spirited witty observant and original writer his prose crackles like motorcycle_exhaust
following the success of hells angels thompson was able to publish articles in a number of well known magazines during the late s including the new york times magazine esquire pageant and others in the times magazine article published in shortly before the summer of love and entitled the hashbury is the capital of the hippies thompson wrote in depth about the hippies of san francisco deriding a culture that began to lack the political convictions of the new left and the artistic core of the beats instead becoming overrun with newcomers lacking any purpose other than obtaining drugs it was an observation on the s counterculture that thompson would further examine in fear and loathing in las vegas and other articles
according to thompsons letters and his later writings at this time he planned to write a book called the joint chiefs about the death of the american dream he used a advance from random house to travel on the presidential_campaign_trail and attend the democratic convention in chicago for research_purposes from his hotel_room in chicago thompson watched the clashes between police and protesters which he wrote had_a_great_effect on his political views the planned book was never finished but the theme of the death of the american dream would be carried over into his later work and the contract with random house was eventually fulfilled with the book fear and loathing in las vegas
thompson also signed a deal with ballantine books in to write a satirical_book called the johnson about lyndon b johnson a few weeks after the contract was signed however johnson announced that he would not stand for re election and the deal was canceled
by late thompson and his family moved back to colorado and rented a house in woody creek a small mountain_hamlet outside aspen in early thompson finally received a royalty_check for the paperback_sales of hells angels and used two thirds of the money for a down_payment on a modest home and property where he would live for the rest of his life he named the house owl farm and often described it as his fortified compound
in thompson ran for sheriff of pitkin county colorado as part of a group of citizens running for local offices on the freak power ticket the platform included promoting the decriminalization of drugs for personal use only not trafficking as he disapproved of profiteering tearing up the streets and turning them into grassy pedestrian malls banning any building so tall as to obscure the view of the mountains and renaming aspen fat city to deter investors thompson having shaved his head referred to his opponent as my long haired opponent as the republican candidate had a crew_cut
with polls showing him with a slight lead in a three way race thompson appeared at rolling stone magazine_headquarters in san francisco with a six pack of beer in hand and declared to editor jann wenner that he was about to be elected the next sheriff of aspen colorado and wished to write about the freak power movement thus thompsons first article in rolling stone was published as the battle of aspen with the byline by dr hunter s thompson candidate for sheriff despite the publicity thompson ended up narrowly losing the election while actually carrying the city of aspen he garnered only of the county wide vote in what became a two way race as the republican candidate for sheriff agreed to withdraw from the contest a few days before the election in order to consolidate the anti thompson votes in return for the democrats withdrawing their candidate for county_commissioner thompson later remarked that the rolling_stone_article mobilized his opposition far more than his supporters
also in thompson wrote an article entitled the kentucky derby is decadent and depraved for the short lived new_journalism_magazine scanlans monthly although it was not widely read at the time the article is the first of thompsons to use techniques of gonzo_journalism a style he would later employ in almost every literary endeavor the manic first person subjectivity of the story was reportedly the result of sheer desperation he was facing a looming deadline and started sending the magazine pages ripped out of his notebook ralph steadman who would later collaborate with thompson on several projects contributed expressionist pen and ink illustrations
the first use of the word gonzo to describe thompsons work is credited to the journalist bill cardoso cardoso had first met thompson on a bus full of journalists covering the new hampshire primary in cardoso who by this time had become the editor of the boston globe sunday magazine wrote to thompson praising the kentucky derby piece in scanlans monthly as a breakthrough this is it this is pure gonzo if this is a start keep rolling thompson took to the word right away and according to illustrator ralph steadman said okay thats what i do gonzo
thompsons first published use of the word gonzo appears in a passage in fear and loathing in las vegas a savage journey to the heart of the american dream free enterprise the american dream horatio alger gone mad on drugs in las vegas do it now pure gonzo_journalism
the book for which thompson gained_most_of_his_fame had its genesis during the research for strange rumblings in aztlan an expos for rolling stone on the killing of the mexican american television_journalist rubn salazar salazar had been shot in the head at close range with a tear_gas_canister fired by officers of the los angeles county sheriffs department during the national chicano moratorium march against the vietnam war one of thompsons sources for the story was oscar zeta acosta a prominent mexican american activist and attorney finding it difficult to talk in the racially tense atmosphere of los angeles thompson and acosta decided to travel to las vegas nevada and take_advantage_of an assignment by sports illustrated to write a word photograph_caption on the mint motorcycle_race held there
what was to be a short caption quickly grew into something else entirely thompson first submitted to sports illustrated a manuscript of words which was as he later wrote aggressively rejected rolling_stone_publisher jann wenner was said to have liked the first or so jangled pages enough to take it seriously on its own terms and tentatively scheduled it for publication which gave me the push i needed to keep working on it thompson later wrote
the result of the trip to las vegas became the book fear and loathing in las vegas which first appeared in the november issues of rolling stone as a two part series it is written as a first person account by a journalist named raoul duke on a trip to las vegas with dr gonzo his pound samoan attorney to cover a narcotics_officers convention and the fabulous mint during the trip duke and his companion always referred to as my attorney become sidetracked by a search for the american dream with two bags of grass seventy five pellets of mescaline five sheets of high_powered blotter_acid a salt_shaker half full of cocaine and a whole galaxy of multi colored uppers downers screamers laughers and also a quart of tequila a quart of rum a case of budweiser a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls
coming_to_terms with the failure of the s countercultural movement is a major theme of the novel and the book was greeted with considerable critical acclaim including being heralded by the new york times as by far the best book yet written on the decade of dope the vegas book as thompson referred to it was a mainstream_success and introduced his gonzo_journalism techniques to the masses
within the next year thompson wrote extensively for rolling stone while covering the election_campaigns of president richard nixon and his unsuccessful opponent senator george mcgovern the articles were soon combined and published as fear and loathing on the campaign_trail as the title suggests thompson spent nearly all of his time_traveling the campaign_trail focusing largely on the democratic partys primaries nixon as an incumbent performed little campaign_work in which mcgovern competed with rival candidates edmund muskie and hubert humphrey thompson was an early supporter of mcgovern and it could be argued that his unflattering coverage of the rival campaigns in the increasingly widely read rolling stone played_a_role in the senators nomination
thompson went on to become a fierce critic of nixon both during and after his presidency after nixons death in thompson famously described him in rolling stone as a man who could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time and said his casket should have been launched into one of those open sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of los angeles he was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president he was an evil manevil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the devil can understand it the one passion they shared was a love of football which is discussed in fear and loathing on the campaign_trail 
thompson was to provide rolling stone similar coverage for the presidential_campaign that would appear in a book published by the magazine reportedly as thompson was waiting for a advance_cheque to arrive he learned that rolling_stone_publisher jann wenner had pulled_the_plug on the endeavor without telling thompson
wenner then asked thompson to travel to vietnam to report on what appeared to be the closing of the vietnam war thompson accepted and left for saigon immediately he arrived with the country in chaos just as the united states was preparing to evacuate and other journalists were scrambling to find transportation out of the region while there thompson learned that wenner had pulled_the_plug on this excursion as well and thompson found himself in vietnam without health_insurance or additional financial_support thompsons story about the fall of saigon would not be published in rolling stone until ten years later
these two incidents severely strained the relationship between the author and the magazine and thompson contributed far less to the publication in later years
the year marked both his divorce from sandra conklin and the release of where the buffalo roam a loose film_adaptation of situations from thompsons early s work with bill murray starring as the author murray would go on to become one of thompsons only trusted friends after the lukewarm reception of the film thompson temporarily relocated to hawaii to work on a book the curse of lono a gonzo style account of a marathon held in that state extensively illustrated by ralph steadman the piece first appeared in running magazine in as the charge of the weird brigade and was excerpted in playboy in 
on july in aspen colorado thompson was pulled over for running a stop_sign at am and began to rave at a state_trooper he also refused to submit to intoxication_tests consequently he was arrested but the drunk_driving charges against him were later dropped
in he covered the us invasion of grenada but would not discuss these experiences until the publication of kingdom of fear years later later that year he authored a piece for rolling stone called a dog took my place an expos of the scandalous roxanne_pulitzer_divorce and what he termed the palm_beach_lifestyle the article contained dubious insinuations of bestiality among other things but was considered to be a return to proper form by many
shortly thereafter thompson accepted an advance to write about couples_pornography for playboy as part of his research in the spring of he spent evenings at the mitchell brothers ofarrell theater striptease_club in san francisco and his experience there eventually evolved into a full length nonfiction_novel tentatively titled the night manager neither the novel nor the article has been published
at the behest of old friend and editor warren hinckle thompson became a media_critic for the san francisco examiner from the mid s until the end of that decade thompsons editor at the examiner david mccumber who would write a mitchell brothers biography not long after jim mitchell fatally shot his brother art in was reportedly deeply disappointed in the quality of thompsons examiner columns
in former porn_director gail palmer visited thompsons home in woody creek she later accused him of sexual_assault claiming that he twisted her breast when she refused to join him in the hot_tub she also described cocaine_use to authorities a six person hour search of thompsons home turned up various kinds of drugs and a few sticks of dynamite all charges were dismissed after a pre trial hearing thompson would later describe this experience at length in kingdom of fear
by the early s thompson was said to be working on a novel called polo is my life which was briefly excerpted in rolling stone in and which thompson himself described in as a sex_book you know sex drugs and rock_and_roll its about the manager of a sex_theater whos forced to leave and flee to the mountains he falls_in love and gets in even more trouble than he was in the sex_theater in san francisco the novel was slated to be released by random house in and was even assigned isbn but was not published
thompson continued to contribute irregularly to rolling stone fear and loathing in elko published in was a well_received fictional rallying cry against clarence thomas while mr bills neighborhood was a largely non fictional account of an interview with bill clinton in an arkansas diner rather than embarking on the campaign_trail as he had done in previous presidential_elections thompson monitored the proceedings from cable_television better than sex confessions of a political junkie his account of the presidential_election_campaign is composed of reactionary faxes sent to rolling stone a decade later he contributed fear and loathing campaign an account of a road_jaunt with john kerry during his presidential_campaign that would be thompsons final magazine_feature
thompson was named a kentucky colonel by the governor of kentucky in a december tribute_ceremony where he also received keys to the city of louisville
despite publishing a novel and numerous newspaper and magazine_articles the majority of thompsons literary output after the late s took_the_form of a volume series_of_books called the gonzo papers beginning with the great shark hunt in and ending with better than sex in the series is largely a collection of rare newspaper and magazine_pieces from the pre gonzo period along with almost all of his rolling stone short pieces excerpts from the fear and loathing books and so on
by the late s thompson received complaints from critics fans and friends that he was regurgitating his past glories without much new on his part these concerns are alluded to in the introduction of the great shark hunt where thompson suggested that his old self committed suicide
perhaps in response to this as well as the strained_relationship with rolling stone and the failure of his marriage thompson became more reclusive after he would often retreat to his compound in woody creek and reject assignments or refuse to complete them despite the dearth of new material wenner kept thompson on the rolling stone masthead as chief of the national affairs desk a position he would hold until his death
thompsons work was popularized again with the release of the film fear and loathing in las vegas which opened to considerable fanfare the novel was reprinted to coincide with the film and thompsons work was introduced to a new generation of readers
soon thereafter thompsons long lost novel the rum diary was published as were the first two volumes of his collected letters which were greeted with critical acclaim
thompsons next and penultimate collection kingdom of fear was a combination of new material selected newspaper_clippings and some older works released in it was perceived by critics to be an angry vitriolic commentary on the passing of the american century and the state_of_affairs after the september attacks
hunter married anita bejmuk his long time assistant on april 
thompson ended his journalism_career in the same way it had begun writing about sports thompson penned a weekly column called hey rube for espncoms page the column ran from to shortly before his death in simon schuster bundled many of the columns from the first few years and released it in mid as hey rube blood sport the bush doctrine and the downward spiral of dumbness modern history from the sports desk
thompson died at his self described fortified compound known as owl farm in woody creek colorado at pm on february from a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head
thompsons son juan daughter in law jennifer winkel thompson and grandson will thompson were visiting for the weekend at the time of his suicide will and jennifer were in the adjacent room when they heard the gunshot mistaking_the shot for the sound of a book falling they continued with their activities for a few minutes before checking on him the police report concerning his death stated that in a typewriter in front of thompson they found a piece of paper carrying the date feb and the single word counselor
they reported to the press that they do not believe his suicide was out of desperation but was a well thought out act resulting from thompsons many painful and chronic medical_conditions thompsons wife anita who was at a gym at the time of her husbands death was on the phone with him when he ended his life
what family and police describe as a suicide_note was written by thompson four days before his death and left for his wife it was later published by rolling stone titled football season is over it read
no more games no more bombs no more walking no more fun no more swimming that is years past more than i needed or wanted boring i am always bitchy no fun for anybody you are getting greedy act your old age relax this wont hurt

he told me years ago that he would feel real trapped if he didnt know that he could commit_suicide at any moment i dont know if that is brave or stupid or what but it was inevitable i think that the truth of what rings through all his writing is that he meant what he said if that is entertainment to you well thats ok if you think that it enlightened you well thats even better if you wonder if hes gone to heaven or hell rest assured he will check out them both find out which one richard milhous nixon went to and go there he could never stand being bored but there must be football too and peacocks
on august in a private ceremony thompsons ashes were fired from a cannon atop_a tower of his own design in the shape of a double thumbed fist clutching a peyote_button to the tune of norman greenbaums spirit in the sky and bob dylans mr tambourine man red white blue and green fireworks were launched along with his ashes as the city of aspen would not allow the cannon to remain for more than a month the cannon has been dismantled and put_into_storage until a suitable permanent location can be found according to his widow anita thompsons funeral was financed by actor johnny depp a close_friend of thompson depp told the associated press all im doing is trying to make sure his last wish comes true i just want to send my pal out the way he wants to go out
other famous attendees at the funeral included us senator john kerry and former us senator george mcgovern minutes correspondent ed bradley and charlie rose actors jack nicholson bill murray benicio del toro sean penn and josh hartnett singers lyle lovett john oates and numerous other friends an estimated people attended the funeral
the plans_for_this_monument_were_initially_drawn by thompson and ralph steadman and were shown as part of an omnibus program on the bbc entitled fear and loathing in gonzovision it is included as a special feature on the second disc of the criterion collection dvd_release of fear and loathing in las vegas labeled on the dvd as fear and loathing on the road to hollywood the video_footage of steadman and thompson drawing_the_plans and outdoor footage showing where he wanted the cannon constructed were planned prior to the unveiling of his cannon at the funeral
thompson is often credited as the creator of gonzo_journalism a style of writing that blurs distinctions between fiction and nonfiction his work and style are considered to be a major part of the new journalism literary_movement of the s and s which attempted to break free from the purely objective style of mainstream reportage of the time thompson almost always wrote in the first person while extensively using his own experiences and emotions to color the story he was trying to follow his writing aimed to be humorous colorful and bizarre and he often exaggerated events to be more entertaining
the term gonzo has since been applied in kind to numerous other forms of highly subjective artistic_expression
despite his having personally described his work as gonzo it fell to later observers to articulate what the phrase actually meant while thompsons approach clearly involved injecting himself as a participant in the events of the narrative it also involved adding invented metaphoric elements thus creating for the uninitiated reader a seemingly confusing amalgam of facts and fiction notable for the deliberately blurred lines between one and the other thompson in a interview in playboy addressed the issue himself saying unlike tom wolfe or gay talese i almost never try to reconstruct a story theyre both much better reporters than i am but then i dont think of myself as a reporter tom wolfe would later describe thompsons style as part journalism and part personal memoir admixed with powers of wild invention and wilder rhetoric
the majority of thompsons most popular and acclaimed work appeared within the pages of rolling stone magazine along with joe eszterhas and david felton thompson was instrumental in expanding the focus of the magazine past music_criticism indeed thompson was the only staff_writer of the epoch never to contribute a music_feature to the magazine nevertheless his articles were always peppered with a wide array of pop_music_references ranging from howlin wolf to lou reed armed with early fax_machines wherever he went he became notorious for haphazardly sending sometimes illegible material to the magazines san francisco offices as an issue was about to go to press
robert love thompsons editor of years at rolling stone wrote that the dividing_line between fact and fancy rarely blurred and we didnt always use italics or some other typographical device to indicate the lurch into the fabulous but if there were living identifiable humans in a scene we took_certain steps
hunter was close_friends with many prominent democrats veterans of the ten or more presidential_campaigns he covered so when in doubt wed call the press_secretary people will believe almost any twisted kind of story about politicians or washington he once said and he was right
discerning the line between the fact and the fiction of thompsons work presented a practical problem for editors and fact checkers of his work love called fact checking thompsons work one of the sketchiest occupations ever created in the publishing world and for the first timer a trip through a journalistic fun_house where you didnt know what was real and what wasnt you knew you had better learn enough about the subject at hand to know when the riff began and reality ended hunter was a stickler for numbers for details like gross_weight and model_numbers for lyrics and caliber and there was no faking it
thompson often used a blend of fiction and fact when portraying himself in his writing as well sometimes using the name raoul duke as an author surrogate whom he generally described as a callous erratic self destructive journalist who constantly drank alcohol and took hallucinogenic drugs fantasizing about causing bodily_harm to others was also a characteristic in his work used to comedic effect and an example of his brand of humor
in the late sixties thompson obtained his famous title of doctor from the universal life church he later preferred to be called dr thompson and his alter_ego raoul duke called himself a doctor of journalism thompson was as fond of personae as wc fields besides raoul duke thompson also toyed with the idea of taking_the names jefferson rank gene skinner and sebastian owl for various purposes literary and non literary naming his compound in woody creek colorado owl farm after the last of these
a number of critics have commented that as he grew older the line that distinguished thompson from his literary self became increasingly blurred thompson himself admitted during a bbc interview that he sometimes felt pressured to live up to the fictional self that he had created adding im never sure which one people expect me to be very often they conflict most often as a matter of fact im leading_a_normal_life and right along side me there is this myth and it is growing and mushrooming and getting more and more warped when i get invited to say speak at universities im not sure if they are inviting duke or thompson im not sure who to be
thompsons writing_style and eccentric persona gave_him_a_cult following in both literary and drug_circles and his cult_status expanded into broader areas after being twice portrayed in major motion_pictures hence both his writing_style and persona have been widely imitated and his likeness has even become a popular costume_choice for halloween
in the documentary breakfast with hunter hunter s thompson is seen in several scenes wearing different che guevara t shirts additionally actor and friend benicio del toro has stated that thompson kept a big picture of che in his kitchen
thompson wrote passionately on behalf of african_american rights and the african_american civil_rights_movement he strongly criticised the dominance in american society of what he called white_power_structures he was a proponent of the right to bear_arms and privacy_rights a member of the national rifle association thompson was also co creator of the fourth amendment foundation an organization to assist victims in defending themselves against unwarranted search and seizure
part of his work with the fourth amendment foundation centered around support of lisl auman a colorado woman who was sentenced for life in under felony_murder_charges for the death of police_officer bruce vanderjagt despite contradictory statements and dubious evidence thompson organized rallies provided legal_support and co wrote an article in the june issue of vanity fair outlining the case the colorado supreme court eventually overturned aumans sentence in march shortly after thompsons death and auman is now free aumans supporters claim thompsons support and publicity resulted in the successful appeal
thompson was a firearms and explosives_enthusiast in his writing and in real_life and owned a vast collection of handguns rifles shotguns and various automatic and semi_automatic weapons along with numerous forms of gaseous_crowd_control and many other homemade devices
thompson was also an ardent supporter of drug_legalization and became known for his less than shy accounts of his own drug_usage he was an early supporter of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws and served on the groups advisory_board for over years until his death he told an interviewer in that drugs should be legalized across the board it might be a little rough on some people for a while but i think its the only way to deal with drugs look at prohibition all it did was make a lot of criminals rich
after the september attacks thompson voiced skepticism regarding the official story on who was responsible for the attacks he suggested to several interviewers that it may have been conducted by the us government or with the governments assistance in thompson told a radio_show_host you sort of wonder when something like that happens well who stands to benefit who had the opportunity and the motive you just kind of look at these basic things i saw that the us government was going to benefit and the white house people the republican administration to take the mind of the public off the crashing economy and i have spent enough time on the inside of well in the white house and you know campaigns and ive known enough people who do these things think this way to know that the public version of the news or whatever event is never really what happened
in thompson regarding politics wrote nixon was a professional politician and i despised everything he stood for but if he were running for president this year against the evil bushcheney_gang i would happily vote for him
thompson wrote many letters and they were his primary means of personal conversation thompson made carbon_copies of all his letters usually typed a habit that began in his teenage_years his letters were sent to friends public_officials and reporters
some of his letters have begun to be published in a series_of_books called the fear and loathing letters the first volume the proud highway saga of a desperate southern gentleman is over pages while the second volume fear and loathing in america the brutal odyssey of an outlaw journalist passed douglas brinkley who edits the letter_series said that for every letter included fifteen were cut brinkley estimated thompsons own archive to contain over letters according to amazoncom the last of the three planned volumes of thompsons letters was allegedly to be published on january as the mutineer rants ravings and missives from the mountaintop_anita thompson has said on herblog that the collection will be released sometime in february amazoncom currently lists the publication_date on its site as february 
many biographies have been written about thompson although he did not write an autobiography but his letters contained asides to his biographers that he assumed could be reading in on his collected letters some of these letters were already bundled into thompsons kingdom of fear though it is not considered an autobiography

birth_asphyxia caused by a reduction in the supply of blood or oxygen to a babys brain during birth is a major cause of death and brain_damage occurring in approximately per births and causing around of all cases of cerebral_palsy brain_hypothermia induced by cooling a baby to around degrees c for days after birth has recently been proven to be the only medical intervention which reduces brain_damage and improves an infants chance of normal survival after birth_asphyxia 
many physicians over the centuries have tried to resuscitate babies after birth by altering their body_temperatures essentially aiming to animate the infant by inducing the onset of breathing little thought was given to brain_protection because cerebral_hypoxia during birth was not linked with later neurological problems until william john little in and even then this was controversial sigmund freud for example famously disagreed and when scientific_studies of neonatal_therapeutic_hypothermia were begun in the s researchers like bjorn westin still reported their work in terms of re animation rather than neuroprotection investigators such as james miller and clement smith carried out clinical observations and careful physiological experiments but although some babies were conscientiously followed up they were not mainly concerned with long term neurological outcome 
however by the s physicians saw hypothermia after delivery was something to be avoided the problem of infants who failed to breath at birth had been solved by the invention of mechanical ventilation so any benefit cooling might have for re animation was no longer needed and an influential trial showed that keeping small and preterm infants warm increased survival these results together with observational and experimental data made it an article of medical faith for decades that babies should not be allowed to get cold 
consequently during the next two decades studies of neonatal_hypothermia in europe and the usa were sporadic and often unsuccessful an interest in cooling for brain_protection was beginning to emerge but contemporary neuroscience provided few useful concepts to guide this research and little progress_was made although across the iron curtain in the soviet union cooling was being applied empirically following birth_asphyxia the language_barrier cold_war_politics and the russians failure to carry out randomised controlled trials contributed to an almost total ignorance of this work in the west indeed a group of russian neonatologists who described hypothermic_neural_rescue during a visit to the neonatal unit in bristol uk met_with_little interest 
in the late s the development of a new set of concepts and problems led to a re examination a new generation of neonatal_researchers were influenced by the growing evidence that protecting the brain against the effects of oxygen_deprivation during labour might be possible these researchers were aware that cooling produced powerful intra ischaemic neuroprotection during cardiac_surgery but a new concept of hypothermic post insult neural_rescue developed this shift in thinking was possible because of at least three major new ideas that were developing at the same time delayed post ischaemic cell death excitotoxicity and apoptosis
the first paradigm_shift that affected neonatal_researchers in particular was the idea that if a baby was resuscitated after cerebral_hypoxia ischaemia there was a period of time before brain_cells started to die osmund reynolds at university college london used the newly developed technique of magnetic resonance spectroscopy mrs to show that the infant_brain_metabolism is normal in the hours after birth_asphyxia and deteriorated only after a distinct delay robert vannucci confirmed the effect with painstaking biochemistry and delayed_injury was also reported in neuropathological studies 
delayed_brain_injury called secondary_energy_failure by reynolds was a critical new idea if brain_cells remained normal for a time and the mechanism of the delayed death could be unravelled it opened the possibility of therapeutic_intervention in what had previously seemed an impossible situation 
the new and transforming concept of excitotoxicity developed from the seminal experiments of john olney and brian meldrum they showed that at least some of the neural_cell_death caused by hypoxia ischaemia is mediated by excess_production of the excitatory_neurotransmitter glutamate and that pharmacological blockade of the n methyl d aspartate receptor could provide good protection against hypoxic_damage olney and meldrum had shifted the paradigm allowing researchers to think of hypoxic ischaemic damage as a treatable disease
however it was still a mystery how and why cells triggered by hypoxia ischaemia should die hours or days later particularly when it became clear that glutamate_levels were not particularly high during secondary_energy_failure the next critical idea came with the discovery of programmed_cell_death a novel form of cell_suicide originally observed as a pathological appearance and named apoptosis falling off as of leaves in the s horvitz raff and evan provided a molecular understanding and showed that apoptosis could be triggered by cellular insults the radical idea that hypoxia ischaemia triggered a cell_suicide programme which could explain the perplexing phenomenon of delayed_cell_death was soon supported by experimental and human data and many researchers believe this helps explain why neural_rescue works in the newborn however the picture is complex both apoptosis and necrosis are present in variable proportions and there seems to be prolonged neurodegeneration after an insult research into this problem continues
these ideas flowed through the perinatal_research_community producing a new belief that neural_rescue after birth_asphyxia should be possible amongst the first to have attempt neonatal neural_rescue in animals were ingmar kjellmer and henrik hagberg in gothenburg and michael johnston in baltimore the potential began to draw in other neonatal_researchers from diverse fields to begin neuroprotection_research including those who came to form the informal neonatal_hypothermia research_group 
peter gluckman and tania gunn were endocrinologists in the university of auckland new zealand and interested in cooling for its effect on thyroid_function they had first cooled a sheep_fetus for endocrine_studies in denis azzopardi john wyatt and david edwards then young researchers working for reynolds were using reynoldss sophisticated mrs approach to replicate secondary_energy_failure in newborn piglets and immature rats in gluckmans laboratory alistair gunn and chris williams developed a simple and elegant biophysical method using cerebral_impedance to do essentially the same thing in fetal sheep marianne thoresen who was working on cerebral_perfusion was prompted to think about neuroprotection by stories of children who fell through the norwegian ice and suffering prolonged drowning in iced water but emerged with preserved cerebral_function
there were many potential therapies around which might achieve neural_rescue and most of these workers did not immediately move to hypothermia magnesium was an appealingly simple excitoxin_receptor_antagonist that protected cells in culture the reynolds group tested it in their piglet_model without success gluckman and gunn started by looking unsuccessfully at flunarizine a calcium_entry_inhibitor edwards picked on nitric_oxide_synthase_inhibition which was also a failure gluckman had success with his innovative studies of igf but could not immediately translate this to clinical_practice
most neonatal_researchers recognise work published in from myron ginsbergs group as starting_point of their interest in post insult hypothermia ginsberg showed that a short period of hypothermia after hypoxia ischaemia in adult rats produced significant protection in the hippocampus soon pusanellis group suggested that at least some of the strong neuroprotective effect of the canonical glutamate_antagonist mk was by reducing body_temperature before long there was a significant body of experimental work on post ischaemic neuroprotection by hypothermia in mature animals these results also stimulated clinical scientists working with adults who had apparent early success in clinical trials 
the informal neonatal_hypothermia interest group was developing gluckman visited london reynolds and wyatt went to oslo edwards went to auckland and thoresen contacted westin then went to work in the reynolds laboratory over the next year or so together and separately they produced a series of reports in piglets immature rats and fetal sheep which showed repeatedly that post insult hypothermia significantly reduced hypoxic ischaemic brain_damage in the developing brain trying to understand how and why cooling might work they showed that it specifically reduced apoptosis and interrupted the excitiotoxic_cascade
thoresen recalls the immediacy of the first hypothermia_experiment in the reynolds laboratory the room was full and she watched with reynolds wyatt edwards and others as the biomarkers remained stubbornly normal after a very severe hypoxic_insult which would normally have caused catastrophic secondary_energy_failure in new zealand there were similar experiences gunn says that he realised that hypothermia was going to work during his third experiment as he watched the expected delayed_injury fail to materialise
as the experimental data continued to accumulate clinical pilot_studies were already being organised although with some trepidation because of the prevailing view that cold was very dangerous for infants there was some controversy over the relative benefits of selective head against whole body_cooling tania and alistair gunn first out of the clinical blocks set out in auckland to study local_head_cooling which they argued would have fewer side_effects edwards and azzopardi now based at hammersmith hospital delayed clinical studies until they had used a computer_model to decide between the two then started whole body_cooling thoresen and andrew whitelaw relocated from oslo to bristol tried both methods 
cooling was now a topic of wider discussion in the neonatal_community and other groups started to organise further experimental and further preliminary clinical studies reviewed in jacobs et al 
however not everyone was convinced the highly respected vannucci laboratory had failed to find any protective effect of post insult cooling and worse ginsbergs group reported that hypothermic_protection in mature rats was only temporary many clinicians thought that the experiments_models were over simplistic and unrepresentitive of the complex clinical situation others thought that brain_damage might have occurred weeks or months earlier although an mri study from hammersmith dispelled this myth 
nevertheless cooling captured the imagination of one of the most influential figures in neonatal_medicine jerry lucey the editor of the top_rated pediatric journal pediatrics had an extraordinary ability to spot new ideas and he became a strong champion of cooling he promoted hypothermia tirelessly and in early made_a_critical_introduction between olympic medical a medium_sized_equipment_company and the cooling_fraternity in in his car on the way to dulles international airport after a series of meetings largely organised by lucey jay jones the owner of olympic medical decided to fund a randomised controlled trial of hypothermic_neural_rescue therapy in newborn_infants olympic would construct a head_cooling_device the olympic cool cap system and provide practical and financial_support for the trial gluckman and wyatt would be principal_investigators and the scientific_committee which developed and ran the trial joined hypothermia_researchers like edwards and whitelaw with new experts donna ferriero richard polin roberta ballard and charlene robertson the newcomers were not all convinced baby coolers ferriero also a distinguished neuroprotection_experimentalist was particularly sceptical but they brought a range of new skills essential to taking hypothermia into a major randomised trial arguably the most important roles in delivering the trial were taken by ted weiler an indefatigable engineer from olympic medical and gunn who became the scientific_officer 
the coolcap study studied cooling for hours started within hours of delivery the protocol was based on the auckland pilot_studies but was somewhat arbitrary the relative merits of different temperatures or lengths of cooling were unclear and the researchers used best estimates based on their animal_experiments cautiously choosing the upper band of the expected therapeutic range no one knew with certainty what effect_size to predicit or even what the best primary outcome was on the divisive question of selective head versus whole body_cooling in the almost total absence of useful data they compromised and used rectal temperature to control a head_cooling_device coolcap thus studied the effect of cooling the whole baby to oc with the expectation some said hope that the brain might be a degree or so cooler
the first infant was enrolled at columbia presbyterian medical center new york on july and all data were collected audited and prepared for analysis by fall the result was reported at luceys annual washington dc hot topics in neonatology meeting in december with full publication in the lancet in coolcap showed a non significant trend to improvement with cooling in the primary outcome of death or disability at months overall but a clear and significant benefit when infants with very severe or long established brain_injury were excluded this was not quite the definitive result they hoped for but the researchers remained resolute gluckman confided to edwards as they relaxed together after the data_presentation in washington that he thought they would never do more important work
after the coolcap trial another major study was published by the national institute for child health and human development nichd neonatal research network the coolcap researchers had previously had lengthy discussions with the network about collaboration because although the network had no experience of hypothermia they had a strong track_record of patient_recruitment however after detailed discussions around the final coolcap protocol broke down the network began a separate trial led by seetha shankaran some network_members were setting up animal_models of hypothermic_neural_rescue providing valuable experience for preliminary experiments the nichd trial found a significant effect of cooling although the study was criticised in some quarters for temperature_instability in the control_group
the question which now faced the community was should cooling become standard of care opinions were divided some observers thought the evidence was sufficient particularly if the growing number of pilot or smaller studies were considered and in december the us food and drug administration fda approved the olympic cool cap system for clinical_use however others pointed out that the results were at best statistically marginal and urged scepticism worryingly hypothermia_trials for head_trauma in adults and older children were failing to show benefit a review_meeting organised by nichd advised that cooling was an emerging therapy but not standard of care the community awaited more data
after a couple of years during which even the original researchers found it difficult always to agree the last major trial that had grown out of the original experimentalist_group was completed the total body hypothermia for pernatal asphyxia trial toby led by azzopardi backed by distinguished trials_specialist peter brocklehurst and theuk national perinatal epidemiology unit developed from the hammersmith pilot_study of whole body_cooling but collected the data needed to allow meta analysis with both coolcap and the nichd studies toby had the advantage of being delayed in starting by the funding timetable of the uk medical research council so that it was still in progress when coolcap and the nichd trial reported marginal benefits making it clear that the trial size should be increased when toby reported it was considerably larger than either previous study and yet showed remarkable consistency with both those trials the point_estimate for effect was similar and meta analysis detailed below showed unequivocally that cooling increases an infants chance of surviving without neurological deficits at months and reduces neurodevelopmental_impairment in survival
the memories of some of the researchers involved in bringing hypothermic_neural_rescue into clinical_practice have recently been collated
much of what is known about the mechanisms of hypothermic_neuroprotection is gathered from studies in mature and adult models what follows uses some of these data while trying to focus on the immature brain more information particularly on adults is given in the article therapeutic_hypothermia
cerebral_hypoxia ischaemia results in reduced cerebral_oxidative_metabolism cerebral_lactic_acidosis and cell_membrane_ionic_transport_failure if prolonged there is necrotic_cell_death although rapid recovery of cerebral_energy_metabolism occurs following successful resuscitation this is followed some hours later by a secondary fall in cerebral_high_energy_phosphates accompanied by a rise in intracellular ph and the characteristic cerebral_biochemical_disturbance at this stage is a lactic_alkalosis in neonates the severity of this secondary impairment in cerebral_metabolism are associated with abnormal subsequent neurodevelopmental outcome and reduced head_growth 
several adverse biological events contribute to this secondary deterioration including release of excitatory_amino_acids which activate n methyl d aspartate nmda and amino hydroxy methyl isoxazolepropionate ampa receptors on neurons and oligodendroglial_precursors accumulation of excitatory_neurotransmitters generation of reactive oxygen_radicals intracellular_calcium_accumulation and mitochondrial_dysfunction whilst necrotic_cell_death is prominent in the immediate and acute phases of severe cerebral_insults the predominant mode of death during the delayed phase of injury appears to be apoptosis neuroprotective mechanisms need to interact with these mechanisms to have beneficial effect
newborn hypoxic ischaemic brain_injury differs from injury in the adult_brain in several ways nmda_receptor_toxicity is much higher in the immature brain apoptotic mechanisms including activation of caspases translocation of apoptosis inducing factor and cytochrome c release are much greater in the immature than the adult the inflammatory activation is different with less contribution from polymorphonuclear_cells and a more prominent role of il whereas il which is critical in the adult_brain is less important the anti oxidant system is underdeveloped with reduced capacity to inactivate hydrogen_peroxide 
mild hypothermia helps prevent disruptions to cerebral_metabolism both during and following cerebral_insults hypothermia decreases the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose and oxygen and reduces the loss of high_energy_phosphates during hypoxia ischaemia and during secondary_cerebral_energy_failure and reduces delayed cerebral lactic_alkalosis the simultaneous increase in cytotoxic_oedema and loss of cerebral_cortical_activity that accompanies secondary_energy_failure is also prevented 
hypothermia appears to have multiple effects at a cellular level following cerebral_injury hypothermia reduces vasogenic_oedema haemorrhage and neutrophil_infiltration after trauma the release of excitatory_neurotransmitters is reduced limiting intracellular_calcium_accumulation free_radical_production is lessened which protects cells and cellular_organelles from oxidative_damage during reperfusion in addition mild hypothermia may reduce the activation of the cytokine and coagulation_cascades through increased activation of suppressor_signalling_pathways and by inhibiting release of platelet_activating_factor
many of the effects induced by mild hypothermia may help to reduce the number of cells undergoing apoptosis experimental and clinical studies indicate that the number of apoptotic neurons is reduced caspase_activity is lessened and cytochrome_c_translocation is diminished by mild hypothermia and there may be an increase in expression of the anti apoptotic protein bcl 
approximately patients have now been studied in randomised controlled trials of hypothermia there is ongoing surveillance of hypothermia treated patients through the toby registry in the united kingdom and also some data_collection of neonatal_encephalopathy_data by the vermont oxford database in the united states it is possible therefore to reach_some_firm_conclusions on the clinical value of hypothermia
a number of randomised controlled trials have now been carried out early synthesis of the available data by the cochrane collaboration suggested that there was a beneficial effect but did not provide unequivocal support for general application however a meta analysis of all studies published in late included new data in particular the toby trial and this provided conclusive evidence that cooling reduces the adverse effects of birth_asphyxia 
this analysis found three trials the coolcap nichd and toby trials which measured neurological outcome at least months after birth these trials report a total of infants taken together they showed a significant benefit of cooling with a significant reduction in death or disability at months after birth typical risk_ratio confidence_intervals p treatment with hypothermia was consistently associated with an increased rate of normal survival survival typical risk_ratio confidence_intervals p there was a significant reduction in cerebral_palsy amongst infants treated with hypothermia compared with controls the relative effects of selective head and whole body_cooling seem indistinguishable
 trials reported mortality_rates after cooling meta analysis of these data showed that fewer infants treated with prolonged moderate hypothermia died typical risk_ratio confidence_interval p
while most observers currently regard hypothermic_neural_rescue therapy as an evidence based clinical treatment which increases any individual childs chance of surviving without brain_damage detectable at months by about there remains much that is unknown long term follow up is in progress to ensure that the benefits persist although an imaging study nested in toby also found reduced brain_tissue_damage in cooled infants which is encouraging it is not clear if cooling initiated later will be beneficial and the nichd network has set out to investigate this the ice trial a pragmatic study which emphasises the role of transport is awaited trials are beginning of therapies added to cooling such as xenon gas or erythropoietin 
the simplicity which attracted empyricists to cooling centuries ago now makes hypothermic_neural_rescue a potentially transforming therapy for low resource environments where birth_asphyxia remains a major cause of death and disability ironically this brings back the problem of cooling infants in an environment where modern resuscitation and intensive care are not available
influences on karl marx are commonly referred to as deriving from three sources german idealist philosophy french socialism and english scottish political_economy although this three_sources_model is an oversimplification it still has some measure of truth
immanuel kant is believed to have had_the_greatest_influence of any philosopher of modern_times kantian philosophy was the basis on which the structure of marxism was built particularly as it was developed by georg hegel hegels dialectical method which was taken up by karl marx was an extension of the method of reasoning by antinomies that kant used 
g w f hegel by the time of his death was the most prominent philosopher in germany his views were widely taught and his students were highly regarded his followers soon divided into right wing and left wing hegelians theologically and politically the right wing hegelians offered_a_conservative_interpretation of his work they emphasized the compatibility between hegels philosophy and christianity politically they were orthodox the left wing hegelians eventually moved to an atheistic position in politics many of them became revolutionaries this historically important left wing group included ludwig feuerbach bruno bauer friedrich engels and marx they were often referred to as the young hegelians
marxs view of history which came to be called historical_materialism is certainly influenced by hegels claim that reality and history should be viewed dialectically hegel believed that the direction of human history is characterized in the movement from the fragmentary toward the complete and the real which was also a movement towards greater and greater rationality sometimes hegel explained this progressive unfolding of the absolute involves gradual evolutionary accretion but at other times requires discontinuous revolutionary leaps episodal upheavals against the existing status_quo for example hegel strongly opposed slavery in the united states during his lifetime and he envisioned a time when christian nations would radically eliminate it from their civilization
while marx accepted this broad conception of history hegel was an idealist and marx sought to rewrite dialectics in materialist terms he summarized the materialistic aspect of his theory of history in the preface to a contribution to the critique of political_economy
in this brief popularization of his ideas marx emphasized that social_development sprang from the inherent contradictions within material life and the social superstructure this notion is often understood as a simple historical narrative primitive communism had developed into slave_states slave_states had developed into feudal_societies those societies in turn became capitalist_states and those states would be overthrown by the self conscious portion of their working_class or proletariat creating the conditions for socialism and ultimately a higher form of communism than that with which the whole process began marx illustrated his ideas most prominently by the development of capitalism from feudalism and by the prediction of the development of socialism from capitalism
ludwig feuerbach was a german philosopher and anthropologist according to feuerbach social and political_thought should take as their foundation people and their material needs he held that an individual is the product of their environment that the whole consciousness of a person is the result of the interaction of sensory_organs and the external world marx and engels saw in feuerbachs emphasis on people and human needs a movement toward a materialistic interpretation of society 
in the essence of christianity feuerbach argued that god is really a creation of man and that the qualities people attribute to god are really qualities of humanity accordingly marx argued that it is the material_world that is real and that our ideas of it are consequences not causes of the world thus like hegel and other philosophers marx distinguished between appearances and reality however he did not believe that the material_world hides from us the real world of the ideal on the contrary he thought that historically and socially specific ideology prevented people from seeing the material conditions of their lives clearly
what distinguished marx from feuerbach was his view of feuerbachs humanism as excessively abstract and so no less ahistorical and idealist than what it purported to replace_namely the reified notion of god found in institutional christianity that legitimized the repressive power of the prussian state instead marx aspired to give_ontological_priority to what he called the real_life process of real human_beings as he and engels said in the german ideology 
 
also in his theses on feuerbach he writes that the philosophers have only described the world in various ways the point is to change it this opposition between firstly various subjective interpretations given by philosophers which may be in a sense compared with weltanschauung designed to legitimize the current state_of_affairs and secondly the effective transformation of the world through praxis which combines theory and practice in a materialist way is what distinguishes marxist philosophers from the rest of philosophers indeed marxs break with german idealism involves a new definition of philosophy louis althusser founder of structural marxism in the s would define it as class_struggle in theory marxs movement away from university_philosophy and towards the workers movement is thus inextricably linked to his rupture with his earlier writings which pushed marxist commentators to speak of a young marx and a mature marx although the nature of this cut poses problems a year before the revolutions of marx and engels thus wrote the communist manifesto which was prepared to an imminent revolution and ended with the famous cry proletarians of all countries unite however marxs thought changed again following louis napoleon bonapartes december coup which put_an_end to the french second republic and created the second empire which would last until the franco prussian war marx thereby modified his theory of alienation exposed in the economic and philosophical manuscripts of and would latter arrive to his theory of commodity_fetishism exposed in the first chapter of the first book of das kapital this abandonment of the early theory of alienation would be amply discussed several marxist theorists including marxist humanists such as the praxis school would return to it others such as althusser would claim that the epistemological_break between the young marx and the mature marx was such that no comparisons could be done between both works marking a shift to a scientific_theory of society
marx did not study directly with hegel but after hegel died marx studied under one of hegels pupils bruno bauer a leader of the circle of young hegelians to whom marx attached himself however marx and engels came to disagree with bruno bauer and the rest of the young hegelians about socialism and also about the usage of hegels dialectic from the young marx progressively broke away from german idealism and the young hegelians along with engels who observed the chartist movement in the united kingdom he cut away with the environment in which he grew up and encountered the proletariat in france and germany
he then wrote a scathing criticism of the young hegelians in two books the holy family and the german ideology in which he criticized not only bauer but also max stirners the ego and its own considered as one of the founding book of individualist_anarchism max stirner claimed that all ideals were inherently alienating and that replacing god by the humanity as did ludwig feuerbach in the essence of christianity was not sufficient according to stirner any ideals god humanity the nation or even the revolution alienated the ego marx also criticized proudhon whom had become famous with his cry property is theft in the poverty of philosophy 
marxs early writings are thus a response towards hegel german idealism and a break with the rest of the young hegelians marx stood hegel on his head in his own view of his role by turning the idealistic dialectic into a materialistic one in proposing that material circumstances shape ideas instead of the other way around in this marx was following_the_lead of feuerbach his theory of alienation developed in the economic and philosophical manuscripts of published in inspired itself from feuerbachs critique of the alienation of man in god through the objectivation of all his inherent characteristics thus man projected on god all qualities which are in fact mans own quality which defines the human_nature but marx also criticized feuerbach for being insufficiently materialistic as stirner himself had point out and explained that the alienation described by the young hegelians was in fact the result of the structure of the economy itself furthermore he criticized feuerbachs conception of human_nature in his sixth thesis on feuerbach as an abstract kind which incarnated itself in each singular individual feuerbach resolves the essence of religion into the essence of man menschliche wesen human_nature but the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual in reality it is the ensemble of the social_relations thereupon instead of founding itself on the singular concrete individual subject as did classic_philosophy including contractualism hobbes locke and rousseau but also political_economy marx began with the totality of social_relations labour language and all which constitute our human existence he claimed that individualism was an essence the result of commodity_fetishism or alienation although some critics have claimed that meant that marx enforced a strict social_determinism which destroyed the possibility of free_will marxs philosophy in no way can be reduced to such determinism as his own personal trajectory makes clear
in when marx was starting to settle his account with hegel and the young hegelians in his writings he critiqued the young hegelians for limiting the horizon of their critique to religion and not taking up the critique of the state and civil_society as paramount indeed in by the look of marxs writings in that period most famous of which is the economic and philosophical manuscripts of a text that most explicitly elaborated his theory of alienation marxs thinking could have taken at least three possible courses the study of law religion and the state the study of natural_philosophy and the study of political_economy he chose the last as the predominant focus of his studies for the rest of his life largely on account of his previous experience as the editor of the newspaper rheinische zeitung on whose pages he fought for freedom of expression against prussian censorship and made_a_rather_idealist_legal_defense for the moselle peasants customary_right of collecting wood in the forest this right was at the point of being criminalized and privatized by the state it was marxs inability to penetrate beneath the legal and polemical surface of the latter issue to its materialist economic and social roots that prompted him to critically study political_economy
political_economy predates the th century division of the two disciplines of politics and economics treating social_relations and economic_relations as interwoven marx built on and critiqued the most well known political_economists of his day the british classical political_economists
from adam smith came the idea that the grounds of property is labour
marx critiqued smith and ricardo for not realizing that their economic concepts reflected specifically capitalist institutions not innate natural properties of human_society and could not be applied unchanged to all societies he proposed a systematic correlation between labour values and money_prices he claimed that the source of profits under capitalism is value_added by workers not paid out in wages this mechanism operated through the distinction between labour_power which workers freely exchanged for their wages and labour over which asset holding capitalists thereby gained control
this practical and theoretical distinction was marxs primary insight and allowed him to develop the concept of surplus_value which distinguished his works from that of adam smith and david ricardo workers create enough value during a short period of the working_day to pay their wages for that day necessary labour however they continue to work for several more hours and continue to create value surplus_labour this value is not returned to them but appropriated by the capitalists thus it is not the capitalist ruling_class that creates wealth but the workers the capitalists then appropriating this wealth to themselves some of marxs insights were seen in a rudimentary form by the ricardian socialist school he developed this theory of exploitation in capital a critique of political_economy a dialectical investigation into the forms value_relations take
marxs theory of business_cycles of economic_growth and development especially in two sector models and of the declining rate of profit or crisis_theory are other important elements of marxs political_economy marx later made_tentative_movements towards econometric investigations of his ideas but the necessary statistical_techniques of national_accounting only emerged in the following century in any case it has proved difficult to adapt marxs economic concepts which refer to social_relations to measurable aggregated stocks and flows in recent decades however a loose quantitative school of marxist economists has emerged while it may be impossible to find exact measures of marxs variables from price_data approximations of basic trends are possible
rousseau was one of the first modern writers to seriously attack the institution of private_property and therefore is sometimes considered a forebear of modern socialism and communism though marx rarely mentions rousseau in his writings he argued that the goal of government should be to secure freedom equality and justice for all within the state regardless of the will of the majority from jean jacques rousseau came the idea of egalitarian_democracy
in france was experiencing a number of social_problems arising out of the industrial revolution a number of sweeping plans of reform were developed by thinkers on the left among the more grandiose were the plans of charles fourier and the followers of saint simon fourier wanted to replace modern cities with utopian communities while the saint simonians advocated directing the economy by manipulating credit although these programs didnt have much support they did expand the political and social imagination of their contemporaries including marx 
louis blanc is perhaps best_known for originating the social_principle later adopted by marx of how labor and income should be distributed from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs 
pierre joseph proudhon participated in the february uprising and the composition of what he termed the first republican proclamation of the new republic but he had_misgivings about the new government because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of the socio economic reform which proudhon considered basic proudhon published his own perspective for reform solution du probleme social in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers he believed this would transfer control of economic_relations from capitalists and financiers to workers it was proudhons book what is property that convinced the young karl marx that private_property should be abolished
in one of his first works the holy family marx said not only does proudhon write in the interest of the proletarians he is himself a proletarian an ouvrier his work is a scientific manifesto of the french proletariat marx however disagreed with proudhons anarchism and later published vicious criticisms of proudhon marx wrote the poverty of philosophy as a refutation of proudhons the philosophy of poverty in his socialism proudhon was followed by mikhail bakunin after bakunins death his libertarian_socialism diverged into anarchist_communism and collectivist_anarchism with notable proponents such as peter kropotkin and joseph djacque
marxs revision of hegelianism was also influenced by engels book the condition of the working_class in england in which led marx to conceive of the historical_dialectic in terms of class_conflict and to see the modern working_class as the most progressive force for revolution thereafter engels and marx worked together for the rest of marxs life so that the collected works of marx and engels are generally published together almost as if the output of one person important publications such as the german ideology and the communist manifesto were joint_efforts engels says i cannot deny that both before and during my years collaboration with marx i had a certain independent share in laying the foundation of the theory and more particularly in its elaboration but he adds marx was influenced by antique materialism especially epicurus to whom marx dedicated his thesis difference of natural_philosophy between democritus and epicurus for his materialism and theory of clinamen which opened up a realm of liberty
marx drew on lewis h morgan and his social_evolution_theory he wrote a collection of notebooks from his reading of lewis morgan but they are regarded as being quite obscure and only available in scholarly editions
giambattista vico propounded a cyclical theory of history according to which human_societies progress through a series of stages from barbarism to civilization and then return to barbarism in the first stage called the age of the gods religion the family and other basic institutions emerge in the succeeding age of heroes the common_people are kept in subjection by a dominant class of nobles in the final stage the age of men the people rebel and win equality but in the process society begins to disintegrate the connection between vicos theory of history and marxs account of the evolution of society is apparent 
marx read darwins the origin of species and recognized its value in supporting his theory of class_struggle he even sent darwin a personally inscribed copy of das kapital in marx understood that darwins work both helped to explain the internal struggles of human_society and provided a material explanation for the processes of nature 
in karl marx wrote to his friend ferdinand lassalle darwins work is most important and suits my purposein that it provides a basis in natural_science for the historical class_struggle despite all shortcomingsit is here that for the first time teleology in natural_science is not only dealt a mortal_blow but itsrational meaning is empirically explained
having read darwins work and mentioned darwin by name in das kapital it is presumable that marx may have been influencedto some degree by darwin
however the depth of the influence if any would certainly seem to be greatly exaggerated by a numberof religious fundamentalists who seek to paint darwins ideas as incredibly dangerous there is nomention of darwin or evolution in the communist manifesto not surprising since darwins on the origin of species was published in years later and the only reference to darwin in das kapital amounts to short footnotes on technological specialization in manufacturing and industry
despite this in the disasters darwinism brought to humanity harun yahya a muslim creationist writes karl marx the founder of communism adapted darwins ideas which deeply influenced him to the dialectic process of history yahya also writes marx revealed his sympathy for darwin by dedicating his most important work das kapital to him 
this last bit is a common misconception that arose from a letter from darwin to edward aveling who later became the lover of marxs daughter eleanor aveling had written to darwin about wanting to dedicatehis book to him but darwin declined and darwins response became mixed with karl marxs papers when eleanormarx inherited her fathers papers from engels the letter was published in in the russian communistmagazine under the banner of marxism which went on to suggest that the enclosures referred to in theletter might have been chapters from das kapital that dealt with evolution it was not until that avelings letter to darwin was discovered debunking this myth

john edward brownlee served as attorney_general of alberta from until in the united farmers of alberta ufa government of herbert greenfield as brownlee was the only lawyer in a caucus formed almost entirely of farmers his role extended beyond the traditional expectations of an attorney_general and ranged from providing legal_advice to explaining how to write a business_letter he also became the governments de_facto leader in the legislative assembly of alberta
ufa members held_widely_disparate_political_views and brownlee quickly became identified with the governments conservative faction he opposed radical changes to the structure of government and urged thrift in public spending as part of the governments attempts to balance its budget brownlee favoured selling its money losing railways and concluding an agreement with the federal_government to give alberta control over its natural_resources he was unsuccessful at both as a member of a farmers government he was also involved in attempts to alleviate drought induced poverty in southern alberta and in investigations into the establishment of a provincial wheat_pool
ufa members of the legislative assembly mlas began to see brownlee as a better leader than the indecisive greenfield a group of them attempted to force greenfield to resign in brownlees favour though brownlee opposed these attempts initially threatening to resign if greenfield did he was eventually persuaded to accept the premiership if greenfield willingly relinquished it brownlee became premier november 
brownlee began his legal career in calgary and the ufa was one of his firms major clients one of the projects he undertook for it was the creation of the united grain growers ugg of whose securities division he became general_manager in he also travelled around alberta with ufa president henry wise wood answering ufa members legal questions while wood spoke to them about politics and the farmers movement though brownlee was not initially interested in the ufas political activities this changed through his association with wood and progressive party of canada leader thomas crerar
until the ufas political activities were limited to advocacy but that year it decided to run candidates in the provincial_election despite brownlees burgeoning interest in politics he did not view himself as part of the ufas political branch and did not run as a candidate indeed he was on vacation in victoria british columbia for most of the campaign
the ufa contested the election without a leader so when it won of the seats in the legislative assembly of alberta it did not know who it would recommend to form a government as premier of alberta wood was not interested and suggested that brownlee should take the position to the latters astonishment brownlee did not believe that as an urbanite and lawyer he would be acceptable to the rural ufa caucus and declined the position went to herbert greenfield
though the ufa mlas were not willing to accept a non farmer as premier many of them realized that the post of attorney_general should go to a lawyer others were less convinced and brownlee was invited to address the ufa caucus he acknowledged that there was no constitutional requirement on the question but advised that a non lawyer attorney_general would be wholly reliant on the advice of the lawyers on his staff with the caucus convinced greenfield asked brownlee to accept the position brownlee demurred reluctant to take the resulting cut in income not eager to leave his family in calgary to work in edmonton the provincial_capital and leery of the high expectations invested in the new government by the provinces farmers ultimately a combination of duty loyalty and ambition convinced him to accept the position though the choice of cabinet_ministers is traditionally the prerogative of the premier as part of the ufas agenda of democratic reform greenfield agreed to present his choices to the caucus for vetting brownlee was approved august and was sworn in two days later
neither he nor greenfield had run as a candidate in the election and neither was a member of the legislature percival baker the ufa member elected for ponoka had died on election_day opening up a seat for one of them a second seat peace river became available when incumbent donald macbeth kennedy resigned to run in the federal_election greenfield seemed a more reasonable candidate for that rugged northern riding than the urban lawyer brownlee and so brownlee was acclaimed as ponokas mla december 
 was the only lawyer in a government composed primarily of farmers and the rest of the cabinet drew_heavily_on_his expertise its reliance on him extended beyond legal_issues to such matters as how to write a business_letter greenfield was among the most dependent and forwarded most controversial issues to his attorney_general for a draft_response greenfield often signed the draft and send it out unchanged the premier eventually relied on brownlee so heavily that brownlee set the agenda for cabinet_meetings the government also relied on brownlee in the legislature where it found itself under relentless attack from the john r boyle led liberals brownlee had the widest debating experience of the ufa members and he was increasingly called upon to counter these attacks his maiden_speech was typical of him i came into this house with considerable trepidation because i knew that sitting opposite would be the former giants of this house men with ability experience and skill since coming in ive listened to all these mengiving their bestand now i blush at my own modesty
when greenfield was asked a difficult question in the legislature he often leaned over to brownlee his seatmate who supplied him with an answer in full view of the legislature many ufa members found this practice humiliating brownlees importance to the government in the legislature was illustrated by an incident in brownlee was on vacation in victoria during a special sitting of the legislature while his presence was usually considered crucial the only item of business scheduled for the session was uncontroversial and passed by a large margin however once this item was dispensed with some members complained that the c payment that they were to receive for the special session was too low greenfield brought_a_motion to double it the amount was increased to in committee at a time when many farmers earned less than per year the move cost the ufa dearly in the eyes of its supporters many ufa mlas privately suggested that the incident would have been avoided had brownlee been present on another occasion in brownlee was absent from the legislature due to illness boyle called him to assure him that he could rest easy since the liberals would not raise_any_difficult_issues in his absence while brownlee appreciated the gesture all involved recognized it as an admission that the government was helpless in the legislature without its strongman
brownlees work as an mla extended beyond the legislature he gave_close_attention to correspondence from his constituents especially those alleging improper treatment at ponokas psychiatric_hospital he prepared thoroughly for speaking_engagements in his riding trying to anticipate all possible questions these measures were reflected in his support in the largely rural riding where the calgary lawyer became a popular and well respected mla
many of the elected ufa members espoused radical political_doctrines calculated to transform the provincial_government brownlee quickly became identified with the caucuss conservative faction at the caucus_meeting that approved his appointment he put_an_end to discussion of whether nominations for justices_of_the_peace should come from ufa locals or its central political committee by asserting that they would continue to be handled by the office of the attorney_general later many ufa mlas argued that only motions explicitly declaring a lack of confidence in the government should be treated as motions of non confidence they were concerned that supporters of the government who nonetheless disagreed with it on a specific issue might be pressured to refrain from voting their consciences on motions such as money_bills that were conventionally considered tests of the governments confidence brownlee warned these mlas that regardless of their beliefs the lieutenant_governor of alberta was free to request the governments resignation any time he considered that it lacked or did not merit the legislatures confidence despite this warning ufa mlas john russell love and alex moore proposed a resolution in the legislature changing the convention the proposal attracted_notice from across canada r b bennett advised brownlee his former clerk to warn moore and love that it was unconstitutional and demand that they withdraw it brownlee was reluctant to do so since a similar proposal had been part of the ufas election_platform and instead moved successful amendments weakening the motion to a vague statement_of_intent
brownlee clashed again with the ufas radical elements on the question of a provincial_bank the writings of c h douglas advocating an economic_system that he called social_credit were attracting notice in alberta and his adherents included many ufa members led by george bevington they sponsored a resolution at the ufa convention in january calling for the creation of a government owned bank after bevingtons introduction support for the resolution was running high brownlee cooled enthusiasm with a speech of his own warning delegates that albertas debt_load could not manage the programs that bevington proposed that a provincial_bank should undertake even so the convention passed a resolution calling on the provincial_government to apply for a bank_charter from the federal_government which was responsible for banking under the british north america act at brownlees recommendation the greenfield government struck a commission under the leadership of university of alberta economist d a macgibbon which strongly recommended against the establishment of a provincial_bank this mirrored brownlees own conclusion reached after investigating state run banks in new zealand and new south wales at the ufa convention bevington and his followers reaffirmed their demands brownlee responded by pointing to the findings of the macgibbon commission and to his contention that the proposal was unconstitutional and would bankrupt the province in this he was supported by henry wise wood whom bevington was challenging for the ufa presidency brownlee proposed instead that the governments treasury_branches should begin to accept deposits
brownlee also advocated a conservative approach on budgetary issues the ufa government inherited a large budget_deficit and brownlee was dissatisfied with greenfields early efforts at reducing it in he warned the premier that unless the government sharply cut expenditures he would find it difficult to defend its fiscal_policy in that years session of the legislature in unsatisfied with greenfields response he made_an_example of his own department cutting staff and taking_a_strict_approach to spending in he found an ally for his position in new provincial treasurer richard gavin reid who impressed on his cabinet_colleagues the need for thrift and recommended the creation of a purchasing_department for coordinating government_expenditures
the provinces poor financial_situation was due in part to its million annual expenditure on railways comprising percent of the budget these expenditures resulted from the collapse of four small railroad syndicates which left the government to finance the rail_construction brownlee believed that these lines the largest of which was the edmonton dunvegan and british columbia edbc line should be sold to either the canadian national railway or the canadian pacific railway though neither was interested in purchasing the lines in both expressed_an_interest in leasing the edbc however the royal bank of canada which held the mortgage on the edbc refused to consent to any lease_arrangement unless the alberta government redeemed its stock in the railway as security for the mortgage brownlee was inclined to agree with minister_of_railways vernor smith that the government should buy the mortgage from the royal bank and become the owner and operator of the line but greenfield was resistant to this approach and resolution of the railways_question had to wait until brownlee was premier
brownlee was also active on natural_resource_issues alberta along with saskatchewan and manitoba had been admitted into confederation without being granted the control over its natural_resources that the older provinces enjoyed over theirs while the federal_government did provide a compensatory grant in lieu of resource_rights alberta sought control over the resources not only because it believed that this would yield higher revenues than the grant but out of sheer pride in prime_minister arthur meighen committed the federal_government in principle to transferring resource_rights all that remained to discuss were the terms alberta while willing to forgo the annual_subsidy wanted compensation for some of the land and resources previously awarded by the federal_government to private_interests including of land granted to eastern railway_companies mineral_leases that deprived the government of royalties for more than half of the of coal extracted from alberta annually and assorted areas with hydroelectric potential that had been yielded to private_companies
 became the provinces chief_negotiator on resource_questions in october though early attempts at reaching agreement were hampered by the unwillingness of the maritime provinces to agree to the necessary constitutional amendments unless their own annual subsidies were increased negotiations between the provincial and federal_government continued intermittently throughout the s liberal prime_minister william lyon mackenzie king occasionally appeared receptive to albertas demands but never fully agreed to them a possible explanation for this is found in a letter from alberta liberal party leader john r boyle to king explaining that the ufa was likely to lose the next provincial_election to boyles liberals unless something extraordinary happens that extraordinary thing which greenfield wants to happen now is obtaining from you the natural_resources at once despite this letter the sides seemed close to agreement in early at a january conference alberta accepted in principle a federal offer of three years of continuing subsidy after the transfer of resource_rights after an exhaustive series of meetings between brownlee and the federal_counsel the agreement went back to the governments for approval as greenfield and brownlee expressed_their_impatience with federal inaction an intergovernmental meeting was convened in may the meeting proceeded at a leisurely pace into june after which king announced that his cabinet would like the summer to consider the agreement in greater detail the albertans returned home in disgust
the consequences of continued control of albertas resources by the federal_government extended beyond the merely financial as albertas smaller towns and rural_areas were being connected to the electrical_grid calgary power made_an_application to the federal_government for hydroelectric rights on the upper bow river not wanting these rights to fall_into_private_hands brownlee made_an_application of his own on behalf of the alberta government it was denied by charles stewart federal minister_of_the_interior and the premier of alberta whom the ufa had defeated in 
in the ufa government passed the mineral tax act which taxed mineral rightsholders at a rate of three cents per acre the two largest such rightsholders the canadian pacific railway and the hudsons bay company urged the federal_government to use its power of disallowance to put_a_stop_to the legislation when the federal_government complied brownlee protested its action on three grounds first as a direct tax the proposed levy was within albertas rights under section of the british north america act and it was constitutional_convention for the federal_government to exercise disallowance only when the impugned legislation was clearly unconstitutional second disallowance allowed the province no recourse to the courts where the constitutionality of the legislation could be tested third the federal_governments stated reasons for disallowing the legislation which were released belatedly by justice_minister ernest lapointe were according to brownlee erroneous and led brownlee to suggest that lapointe a qubcois lawyer trained in the civil_law_tradition of his home_province rather than the common_law_system used in the rest of canada must be unfamiliar with the land holding system outside of quebec brownlees attacks were rejected and the disallowance stood
the ufa took_office at a time of drought in the southern regions of the province at brownlees instigation the government appointed a three person panel led by charles alexander magrath to investigate the problem in the government passed the drought relief act the act a brownlee brainchild created a drought_relief_commissioner to whom farmers in affected areas could turn for financial counselling and asset_administration it authorized the adjustment of farmers debts to levels that were within the debtors means but still sufficiently acceptable to creditors that their willingness to make_loans would not disappear altogether brownlee hoped that this system would provide affected farmers with sound financial advice and facilitate the fair division of farmers assets among competing creditors without forcing farmers to pay high legal fees in this was replaced by the debt adjustment act which strengthened the commissioners powers and was intended to extend his jurisdiction over the entire province due to opposition from lenders the portions of the act dealing with other than drought stricken areas were never proclaimed
 name_change of the legislation reflected brownlees growing belief that farmers financial troubles were due to factors more systemic than lack of rain angry over the federal_governments decision to allow the first incarnation of the canadian wheat board cwb to lapse many albertan farmers began to advocate the pooling of their wheat which would render individual farmers less susceptible to the machinations of grain_speculators by introducing collective_marketing with each farmer receiving an averaged identical price farmers in saskatchewan and manitoba were more adamant about the return of the cwb prime_minister king eventually agreed to its re creation provided that at least two of alberta saskatchewan and manitoba passed enabling legislation and found the personnel necessary to sit on the board by june the provinces had not found anybody suitable interest in pooling experienced a resurgence in july a ufa meeting which brownlee attended as the governments representative endorsed the creation of a wheat_pool as soon as practicable brownlee and his cabinet_colleague richard gavin reid undertook_an_investigation of how soon this might be which included a trip to san francisco to meet with aaron sapiro an american agricultural_cooperative_leader sapiro proclaimed that a wheat_pool could be organized in a few weeks though both brownlee and reid disagreed and returned to canada committed to caution however in their absence the edmonton journal and calgary herald had invited sapiro to tour alberta and his speeches stirred up extravagant expectations among ufa members for immediate action in time for the new organization to market the crop
faced with the zeal of its membership the ufa leadership appointed a person committee including brownlee to create the alberta cooperative wheat producers limited the membership_fee was to be three dollars and the organization was to work with similar organizations in saskatchewan and manitoba the provincial_governmentat brownlees insistenceand the ugg both provided startup_loans the ugg also took_the_lead in agreeing to let its grain_elevators be used by the pool which allowed brownlee to defeat those committee_members who thought the new company should acquire its own elevators
by the end of august it was obvious that the organizations in saskatchewan and manitoba were not going to be ready in time for the crop and the committee decided to proceed alone it determined that if farmers representing half of albertas total wheat_acreage agreed to pool their crop by september the pool would proceed brownlee believed that this was an impossible objective despite the experimental and unproven nature of the model and the as yet nonexistent organization that was to execute it this objective_was met the alberta wheat_pool was born by the following years harvest comparable organizations had formed in saskatchewan and manitoba and a central selling agency csa was formed to sell all three provinces wheat the csas first president alexander james mcphail whom brownlee helped select offered brownlee the position of csa general_manager at the attractive salary of per year a figure that brownlee had helped set at the urging of his government_colleagues and the ufa leadership both of who felt his continued presence in edmonton was vital to the ufa governments hold_on_power he declined he was instead made the csas general_counsel brownlee was also heavily involved in the creation of a livestock_pool and three dairy_pools as a sort of poolmania hit alberta farmers
as attorney_general brownlee inherited the prohibition implemented by the previous liberal government while the ufa base and public_opinion both favoured prohibition the existing law was full of loopholes and unevenly enforced some judges opponents of prohibition refused to convict defendants charged with liquor_offences the ufa had pledged during the election_campaign to introduce prohibition in fact as well as in law and the task fell to brownlee he initially cooled expectations by announcing that he had no interest in making any hasty or ill considered move either in changing the law or altering enforcement the existing one
 september constable steve lawson of the alberta provincial police was murdered at his blairmore home by bootlegger emil picariello and his companion florence lassandra he was the third policeman killed in alberta in liquor related incidents in the murder opened up a rift between albertans of british descent who saw bootlegging as an affront to the rule of law even if they did not support prohibition and albertans of southern and eastern european descent who found prohibition to be something of a joke and accepted bootlegging brownlee authorized the deployment of special constables to apprehend picariello and lassandra once they were arrested he appeared personally at the prosecutions bench alongside a a mcgillivray reputedly albertas best courtroom_lawyer whose services he secured specifically for the case picariello and lassandra were convicted and sentenced to death by hanging
by the time of their executions in may public_opinion was turning against prohibition the sentiment that criminal_activities such as picariellos were the inevitable result of prohibition_laws became a popular one as did the view that the government should legalize and regulate liquor_sales brownlee morally supportive of prohibition began to personally support this course believing that prohibition was unenforceable in the face of widespread public opposition a referendum opted for the end of prohibition in brownlee guided the government liquor control actdrafted with the assistance of r b bennett who received for his servicesthrough the legislature
as attorney_general brownlee was responsible for administration of the lords day act which forbade most commerce on sundays charles huestis of the lords day alliance took_issue with the edmonton orchestras sunday concerts on the grounds that by opening them only to its subscription_holders it was de_facto charging admission and that by paying its musicians honoraria it was gainfully employing them in their regular professions on sundays brownlee declined to prosecute since courts had previously held that the concerts were legal huestis retorted that as attorney_general brownlee should make them illegal to which brownlee responded that he fully appreciated the importance of the sabbath and did not need to be lectured on the subject by huestis there were also complaints about farmers violating the act by working sundays brownlee felt that such complaints were often more about conflicts between neighbours than preservation of the sabbath and prosecuted only the most gratuitous and flagrant cases
in the federal_election of the canadian house of commons seats were won by progressives and allied factions including the ufa which won both seats it contested liberal prime_minister designate william lyon mackenzie king had only a minority and expected to rely on the support of these progressives to govern progressive leader thomas crerar envisioned forming a coalition_government with the liberals and knew that he would be expected to provide cabinet_members from alberta which had been swept by progressives and allied parties seeing no cabinet_material among the elected members he sent an emissary to edmonton to convince greenfield or brownlee to enter federal_politics brownlee refused and advised greenfield to do the same on the grounds that their abandonment of provincial_politics soon after the ufas election would be seen as a betrayal
as greenfields shortcomings became obvious brownlee found himself fielding propositions closer to home in a group of ufa mlas dissatisfied with greenfieldincluding george johnston george maclachlan william shield donald cameron oran mcpherson and austin claypoolapproached brownlee to advise him that they planned to ask the premier to resign in favour of his attorney_general to their surprise brownlee immediately told them that if greenfield resigned so would he faced with brownlees refusal to cooperate with their coup the dissidents relented they made_another_attempt in brownlee again threatened to resign but this time was persuaded by henry wise wood to accept the crown if greenfield relinquished it willingly greenfield assured brownlee that he had not wanted the job of premier in the first place and would happily see brownlee take it from him faced with these assurances brownlee agreed to form a government and became premier of alberta november he remained attorney_general until after the election when he appointed the newly elected john lymburn to replace him
kfac was a commercial classical_music_radio_station in los angeles broadcasting for most of its life on khz am and subsequently in both simulcast and separate programming on mhz fm as well only of nearly commercial_radio_stations in the united states play classical_music and kfac was considered one of the best on september at pm new owners changed both its name and its format depriving southern california of a major cultural_institution during its heyday the station was arguably the most important cultural_organization in the los angeles area having greater influence on lovers of classical_music than even the los angeles philharmonic announcers such as howard rhines dick crawford thomas cassidy carl princi fred crane steve allen alfred leonard tom dixon bill carlson dick joy tom franklin ed stoddard bernie alan rodger layng steve markham and doug ordunio were featured on the station for several years the station also carried the daily syndicated adventures in good music with karl haas other regularly scheduled programs were hosted by leonora schildkraut werner klemperer and gussie moran 
many of its programs such as the gas company evening concert luncheon at the music center and the world of opera lasted for decades with the gas company show airing for over years the stations djs also had unusual career longevity according to some estimates their collective tenure at the station was over years this unique staying_power and the fact that at times kfac was the only classical_musical station in los angeles kusc its last competitor did not convert to full_time classical_music broadcasting until and despite being non commercial never achieved the listenership of the professionally formatted kfac meant that several generations of angelenos grew up listening to the station that along with its cultural authority gave_the_station_a_special_place in their affections
like most radio_stations in the s kfac did not fill one niche but rather broadcast a wide variety of programming including baseball_games from the pacific coast league its evolution into the all classical_music format was a slow process over many years its first classical_music show began in december when thomas cassidy began hosting a two hour nightly program sponsored by the southern california gas company eventually the station added a second show musical masterpieces it was cassidys responsibility to build the musical library for these shows
in the stations owner el cord the fac in the stations call_letters stood for fuller auburn cord the auburn cord duesenberg dealer in the los angeles area and western_region_headquarters for the auburn automobile co the transmitter was located on the roof of the building was touring the station when he saw for the first time the huge collection of discs a full symphony might take up twelve rpm discs kfac owned cord decided to make_better_use of this investment by switching to all classical_music management tested the waters on this idea by asking the audience if they wanted another nighttime_program lucky lager dance time which played pop and swing_tunes to continue or if they would prefer more classical classical won by a slim margin
tom dixon hosted the afternoon_shift his frequent errors from mispronouncing the names of conductors and performers to playing movements of concertos and symphonies in the wrong order prompted listener sarah lee halpern to write to dixon suggesting he name his show music and mistakes with tom dixon for a long time afterwards every time dixon made_an_error he would say im sorry sarah lee dixons less formal atmosphere and willingness to admit his errors on the air endeared him to audiences another listener once asked dixon who writes your mistakes for years dixon signed off with the phrase ttfn ta ta for now dick crawford on the weekends was famous for playing opera_records out of order and once played bachs brandenburg concerto at the wrong speed
from kfac broadcast performances from the hollywood bowl the station pioneered an early form of stereo_broadcast by having two microphones on different sides of the bowl listeners at home who had two radios were instructed to place them seven to twelve feet apart and tune one to the fm_band and the other to kfacs am_frequency this method of producing stereo came_to_an_end with the advent of fm_multiplexing 
bowl broadcasts featured an intermission_program and interview hosted by thomas cassidy on non broadcast nights cassidy appeared onstage at intermission to welcome the audience to the venue ultimately he was christened the voice of the hollywood bowl however ernest fleishmann who had been hired as executive_director of the los angeles philharmonic upon assuming management of the hollywood bowl terminated cassidys appearances
from to carl princi hosted the world of opera heard weekdays at pm this hour long program played selections from a wide variety of operas both famous and obscure another well known program was continental varieties which played every weekday afternoon at pm with distinctive theme_music by the english light_music_composer eric coates
the los angeles music center a three theatre complex opened in luncheon at the music center was created in the early s by thomas cassidy who also hosted the program for its first eleven years the progam was considered by many the pre eminent talk_show on which to plug theatrical and musical events in the southern california area broadcast weekdays live from the then pavilion restaurant of the dorothy chandler pavilion of the music center with recorded shows only on holidays the show interviewed not only musicians but also actors and directors who were either involved in local productions or just visiting the area the guests actually did eat lunch during the show during musical_interludes though the host did not nonetheless the presence of other diners at the restaurant gave the show one of its hallmark elements the sounds of plates and cutlery clacking in the background originally the program was broadcast using one microphone in the middle of the table eventually that was increased to three which decreased the need for everyone talking to lean so far forward martin workman succeeded thomas cassidy and hosted the show for years
during the latter years of the station kfac made_various_attempts to appeal to a younger audience most of these attempts were brought about by some of the youngest staff_members dennis parnell and doug ordunio
one of the most unusual programs of all was the institution of global village which was heard from until it was conceived by then fm_programmer dennis parnell who was also a professional singer and voice_teacher in the los angeles area the basic idea of the show was to extend the concept of style so that all types of music would be considered appropriate one of the most unusual juxtapositions attempted by parnell during these early stages was to combine an obscure wordless choral_composition by sergei rachmaninoff with janis joplins recording of the song mercedes benz this was considered rather shocking to some of the stations dyed in the wool listeners however it did serve to attract a number of younger listeners as well as older listeners with open minds who were interested in hearing new ideas the station had often been criticized as a dinosaur and the announcing style was viewed as stodgy its opening tagline spoken each week by host carl princi was welcome to global village a meeting_place for the i and the ear
after several months on the air parnell decided that he should receive additional monies in order to continue the production of the show since the show was rather time consuming to prepare he proceeded to tell program_director carl princi that he would stop_production of the show if his demands_were_not met princi then had_a_meeting with then library_employee doug ordunio princi asked ordunio if it would be possible for him to continue production of global village if parnell made_good on his threat to end the program he agreed to continue since he also possessed a vast musical knowledge regardless of style this move effectively ended the friendship between parnell and ordunio parnell left the station around april ordunio was installed as the new fm_programmer a job he continued until dec 
under ordunios direction global village ascended to greater heights and created more unusual sounds and experiments of music such as the night a slow movement from a mahler symphony and a bruckner symphony were heard simultaneously
ordunio was responsible for creating other provocative classical_music programs such as at home with which featured interviews recorded at the homes of classical_musical celebrities who lived in southern california he also produced five hour specials collectively known as the circular path which expounded the idea that all music was bounded by a series of concepts and forms which would eventually repeat themselves the program began with the sound of the aortic pulse recorded within a mothers uterus the first sound ostensibly heard by a fetus and then took listeners through the history_of_music with compositions as well as interviews with prominent musical figures the final show was four hours of conjectures about the future of classical_music the most unusual idea set forth was stated by composer henry brant who said that we would someday find ourselves in a world of music_pollution the entire program ended with a live recording of singer peter allen performing everything old is new again which was basically the philosophy behind the entire hour program
the last show created by ordunio before the stations decline was making waves a program of new_age_music airing during a period before the creation of such stations as the wave at the time the program was instituted on friday nights at pm the only broadcast vehicle for this music was a show known as midnight caf on knx fm
this program and global village were abandoned by robert goldfarb program_director under louise heifetz because they were deemed inappropriate for the stations image
these recollections are by former announcer doug ordunio
one of the funniest moments on luncheon at the music center occurred during the tenure of host thomas cassidy since the program was run live and without tape_delay the guests needed to be on their best behavior cassidy was a strict roman_catholic one day when composerconductor lukas foss was a guest on the show he suddenly spouted out this uncensored remark there is always that wonderful story told about beethoven who wrote a letter to a music_critic saying what i shit is better than what you write cassidy was stuck because nothing could prevent the offending word from being broadcast
after martin workman took over the program another wonderful occasion was his interview of the guests who were in the current la production of a chorus line for music workman needed to play the original broadway cast recording however he didnt audition the recording for lyrical content and so all the songs with bad lyrics from the t and a song on down went right over the air much to the consternation of workman
thomas cassidy was like a ghost one never saw him in the halls of the station he would arrive in the middle of the night record and leave the lps for the next weeks shows and disappear back to the sf valley he always prided himself on his consistent professional deportment on the air one night i decided to tune in the gas company program as i was driving in my car the familiar tchaikovsky theme was heard cassidy usually said good evening friends this is thomas cassidy however this time we heard good evening friendswhat the hells going on here then i heard the volume turned down on the voice_track when the engineer susan rouzer deemed it was ok to proceed she warily turned the track back up cassidys final word before the first_front_announcement were you get a lot more than gas from the gas company i immediately pulled over and phoned the station telling susan dont let that voice_track out of your sight that is a keeper put it on my desk after the show
tom franklin called the dean of southern california business_news_reporters who hosted executive report on kfac am fm for many years was the best man for the job he was often gone on sponsored press_junkets around the world and he spoke with many top_people at corporations everywhere his show was the source of many intentional as well as unintentional bits of humor 
he was also a notorious tippler and it was noted that he was probably one of the few people who fell down the stairs in the posh wilshire blvd restaurant perinos without spilling a drop of his gin and tonic his reputation was shared with doug ordunio and engineer richard nielsen who worked the morning_shift for several years the trio kept_a_collection of all the empty liquor_bottles whose contents they had consumed on the station_premises these were place on top_of the record_shelves in a location that could not be seen by the general public when they were finally discarded after several years they filled a large trash_can
one of the funniest intentional moments on the show was when franklin interviewed the owner of the dutch liqueur_company known in that country as wyn and fokking tom got the executive to explain the companys transition to the us market and the owners were warned that they needed to change the name due to the similarity of one of its names to an obscene word in english their solution was to change the name to bols which when spoken by the netherlander seemed very similar to the english slang_word for testicles
franklin was also known for breaking_into_laughter on the air so uncontrollably that it would take him minutes to recover this happened quite a number of times so much so that in the master_control room a tape was kept which was labeled the tom franklin memorial reel the story he loved to tell was one from his earlier days when in the middle of a longer scripted segment he heard a click on the desktop_next to him when he glanced up to see what it was some person had placed a tall drink_glass partially filled with water and a handful of alka seltzer tablets a condom had been stretched over the top_and as the tablets fizzed away the condom rose to an erect position franklin lost it again
one of the funniest things in which almost the entire staff participated was a video_project that was created as a parting_gift to the station_manager george fritzinger and his exceptional german secretary regina sears it was a station_tour conducted by the longtime kfwb news_announcer dan evey who was married to a member of the stations sales_department michelle davis 
the search which visited all areas of the station was to find the office of salesman courtney thompson which was actually placed far into the recesses of the record_library near the offices of music_director clyde allen fm_programmer doug ordunio and assistant_programmer steven de mena
all of the staff participated and along the wayward path gave_their_farewells to george and regina obviously the staff_members who had the greatest senses_of_humor provided some of the funniest moments on the tape perhaps the most audacious segment came near the end when the camera visited the fm_studio where doug ordunio was apparently but not actually on the air he was seated behind the mike and before he was about to talk on the air he arranged some mysterious white powder actually powdered sugar on top_of a large square mirror and with a straw pretended to snort cocaine
after doing this he seemed to open the mike and begin cursing wildly as he announced a piece of music the white powder was covering his nose when this tape was shown at a reunion of the staff given at sportsmens lodge on ventura blvd this spot provided one of the biggest laughs of the evening
the tape concluded with the actual homeless man who often reclined beneath one of the shade_trees outside the station with his dog waving and saying his goodbye to george and regina those two left before the notorious firing of new_years actually as salesman courtney thompson left the station after having been let go he said to the library_staff who were in their offices watch out theres blood spurting everywhere
one of doug ordunios favorite tag_lines for a station_id was kfac fm los angeles the bastion of sanity for southern california
cleveland broadcasting purchased kfac from the cord estate and was itself purchased after a successful campaign by atlantic states industries asi a subsidiary of the mcgavrin guild rep company under asi kfac ended its ban on commercial jingles previous policy had been that all commercials had to be voiced by kfac_announcers while music_beds usually classical were ok ad_agency_jingles were anathema asi also instituted the combo_operation of broadcast consoles so that kfac_announcers finally became radio_djs previously engineers had spun the records and announcers had merely announced either live or on tape when time came for federal communications commission fcc license_renewal a group of challengers also applied for the license claiming that kfac was not serving the local african_american community this seemed a ludicrous charge because the station never discriminated against any group in its choice of featured composers or performers
investigations seemed to uncover that the protesting group had challenged other station_licenses for the purposes of extorting substantial amounts of money from the station_owners it is not known precisely how much money was paid by the owners of kfac to settle a possible lawsuit but typically when a stations license is being contested during the renewal_process there is a slim chance of it being sold 
in a group of investors headed by louise heifetz daughter in law of the violin_virtuoso jascha heifetz purchased the station for around million she and her accomplice program_director robert goldfarb fired most of the staff_announcers in the hope that new talent would attract new listeners the highly respected engineering_staff was also laid off in the new_years blood_bath of supposedly goldfarb had been hired to do the same for manager wallace smith at kusc a few years before
during the next three years the stations ratings declined and it was sold to evergreen media who changed its format and recast it as kkbt fm the beat which eventually moved to fm an rb station several years ago ralph guild the top_man in charge of the company that owned kfac confided that putting the station up for sale was one of the biggest mistakes_he_ever made
in the new owners donated both the kfac call_sign and the classical record_library to university of southern california radio_station kusc which assigned the call_sign to its santa barbara satellite
today the frequency is home to hot old school and rb the kfac call_letters at home on the santa barbara translator for kusc for over a decade were replaced when the station chose to have all of its affiliates have call_letters ending with sc

karsa orlong is a fictional character in steven eriksons fantasy_series malazan book of the fallen he makes_his_first_appearance in the novel deadhouse gates as toblakai bodyguard to shaik his past is revealed in the subsequent novel house of chains
karsa orlong is a teblor warrior of the uryd tribe his grandfather pahlk orlong was a famed warrior who had centuries before gone into the lowlands from the laederon plateau and slew many children as the teblor call lowlanders karsa grew up on these stories and believed that was how a true teblor warrior was to behave karsas father synyg did not approve of this mindset for he knew pahlks exploits to be lies and twistings of the truth however no one else knew this and so karsa organized a raid in honor of both his grandfather and his god urugal the woven as warleader of his group he and his comrades bairoth gild and delum thord raided through sunyd and rathyd lands to finally arrive at the same place where pahlk had his escapades along the way his group encountered and freed the forkrul assail known as calm calm attacked karsa seeing the influence of the teblor gods on him but karsa was barely injured as delum thord defended him and received severe brain_damage in the attempt becoming reduced to a child like state
upon reaching the lowlands karsa and his party found a small fortified town instead of the farm his grandfather had raided during the attack on this town delum thord was killed and bairoth gild and karsa were both captured bairoth was slain and karsa was soon after sold into slavery and lost his faith in his gods after weeks of being chained to a wagon_bed for transport to the sea karsa and his companion torvald nom found freedom in the fragment of kurald emurlahn known as the nascent during their time in this realm karsa and torvald boarded the silanda and slew the tiste edur on board they met up with other survivors from the slaving ship that had been wrecked in the nascent and returned to the normal world with them arriving just off the shore of seven cities near ehrlitan karsa and torvald nom left the slavers behind on the shore and encountered the supposedly dead napan urko who called himself keeper and dabbled in archaeology they left for ehrlitan and were soon re enslaved by the very same slaver silgar
the group was captured by malazan forces after arrival in ehrlitan silgar claiming karsa as a slave he had recaptured both silgar and karsa were imprisoned and karsa wound up with a tattoo on his face marking him as an escaped slave karsa and his cellmate later escaped and fled into the panpotsun odhan whereupon karsa was told of his true racial_identity as a thelomen toblakai from whom the teblor people were descended karsa known from this point on as toblakai goes with his cellmate leoman of the flails into the holy desert raraku and becomes the loyal bodguard to shaik
eventually karsa orlong leaves the holy desert raraku having been persuaded to go_in_search of a jhag horse he proceeds west into the jhag odhan this move was also one his false gods desired along his journey he encounters and fights icarium the jhag known as the slayer of the ten thousand and karsas ironwood_sword is destroyed neither icarium nor karsa is slain as both are knocked unconscious in the clash
shortly thereafter karsa orlong finally meets his gods in the jhag odhan who prove to be tlan imass who were shattered in battle millennia earlier they reveal to him that he was not just their pawn in their plans to regain physical_form but karsa had also been made the knight of chains in a tellann infused sacred cavern the seven unbound tlan imass help karsa orlong create an unbreakable sword of stone into which the souls of delum thord and bairoth gild go infusing it with bloodthirst karsa now rearmed and faced with manifestations he could attack shrugged off the facade of doing as the unbound told him and drove six of them off further destroying the seventh siballe the unfound on his way out he encounters the tiste edur warrior trull sengar and his tlan imass companion onrack karsa was not in a mood to kill them and so the pair luckily survived
a short time later karsa meets a jaghut and his sister who help karsa obtain the jhag horse he had set out to collect in the first place karsa then turns around and rides back into the holy desert
upon arriving back in the oasis at the time of the final battle in which the army of the apocalypse was crushed karsa proceeded to kill several members of the camp with whom he had_issues though he could not find all of his targets while scouring the camp karsa encounters two of the hounds of darkness known as deragoth who had returned to life and butchers them with frightening ease tying the hounds heads to his horse karsa speeds off into the desert at dawn telling the malazan forces they are no longer his sworn_enemy
at this time karsa vows to return home and claim the army the unbound tlan imass had set aside for him using this force to raise his people from the level to which they had sunk karsa then on his way back to his people encounters a human woman the witch samar dev in the desert who happens to be dying of thirst he helps her and notes in passing that the reason that she is dying is because the self powered carriage she built broke down
he travels with her to her village where people are immediately suspicious of him samar dev persuades them to leave him alone
learning of a castle into which people have disappeared karsa decides to find out whats inside here he finds a kchain chemalle nahruk and kills it after a ferocious fight however the village_inhabitants remain suspicious of him and karsa decides to leave with samar dev
after a long journey they meet a tiste edur fleet on a mission to collect champions for their emperor rhulad sengar who is the king in chains the toblakai decides to go quietly for two reasons to prove his might against the seemingly unkillable emperor and also because he discovers that icarium lifestealer is to challenge the emperor as well

kyle reese is the primary_character in the first terminator film the posthumous father of john connor and the love of sarah connor he is played by michael biehn in the first terminator films jonathan jackson in the television_series and played as a teenager by anton yelchin in terminator salvation
kyle reese sergeant tech com en a soldier in the human resistance from the post apocalyptic future of the terminator where most of humanity had already been wiped out in a deadly nuclear_war on august th sparked off by an artificial_intelligence known as skynet the sentient_computer_system launched a genocidal war on the survivors
kyle reese was born after the nuclear_attacks although in some terminator media such as the sarah connor chronicles he was born before the attacks he was later captured by skynet forces as a child and to survive he was forced to work in one of skynets concentration_camps where others are sent to their deaths his freedom comes when a resistance_movement led by john connor freed him and the others from skynet afterwards reese served in the nd infantry under justin perry from to before transferring to tech com under john connor someone he comes to admire and coincidentally consider his closest friend eventually the resistance rallies enough remaining human forces to launch a successful final assault on skynets central complex
the final assault eventually allows the human resistance to cripple skynet as reese explains in the terminator in the resistance is able to smash through the last of skynets defense_grids allowing them to enter skynets main compound and destroy it skynet however has a final unexpected option using experimental time_displacement_equipment skynet sends one of its most feared machines a t series terminator back to pre apocalypse los angeles california on may to assassinate the young sarah connor known to have been the mother of resistance_leader john connor and thus prevent the birth of connor and the success of his future rebellion
realizing what skynet is attempting to do connor sends a soldier to intercept the terminator sergeant kyle reese volunteers once he had gone through the time_displacement_equipment is destroyed leaving only him and the terminator in 
arriving unarmed and not knowing what the terminator looks like in its human disguise reese locates and follows sarah connor shadowing her until the t attempts to carry out its mission he rescues her warning her of the impending doom of the human_race and of the future significance carried by her and her unborn son though initially hostile towards reese sarah grows to trust and love him as he becomes the only thing between her and the terminator on the run from the terminator reese and sarah have_sex in which her son and future leader john connor is conceived
having grown up in the future where the machines had all but wiped out the human_race reese is both physically and mentally hardened his body is scarred from action against the machines including healed burns as a result of wounds sustained after destroying an enemy as witnessed in a nightmare when he tries to sleep
in a deleted scene when he tries to stop_sarah from going to cyberdyne systems he sees something he has never seen before what the world looks like before the war in the future he says he thinks of it as a dream the trees and stream the flowers and sarah all beautiful he bursts_into_tears saying it hurts and he believes he does not belong there and he was not meant to see any of this he then agrees with sarah that they should try to change the future
though hard and battle_weary reese had_a_love for sarah connor a woman whom he had never met and only knew through a photo the affection kyle reese felt for sarah was based on the legend that surrounded her and on the image of her from the photograph given to him by john connor
reeses life however is cut_short when both he and sarah are forced to confront the terminator after a high_speed_chase where he is wounded by gunfire and thinking that they destroyed the terminator in an explosion of a fuel_truck they are again chased by the now metal endoskeleton inside an automated factory later revealed to be owned by cyberdyne systems
kyle turns on various mechanical equipment as visual cover while the terminator batters its way through the door after sarah accidentally turns on a machine they are discovered by the terminator after reaching the stairs of a footwalk reese tells sarah to run_for cover while kyle tries to beat the terminator with a metal pipe
the terminator knocks kyle to the deck of the footwalk though dazed reese reaches for his last homemade pipe_bomb lights it and wedges it in between the terminators pelvic strut and torso the terminator is blown apart and reese is killed the terminator though blown in half and missing an arm is not destroyed a wounded sarah is able to find enough courage and resolve to destroy it crushing the machine inside a mechanical_press while being taken away by paramedics soon afterward sarah tearfully watches as reeses dead_body is zipped up in a body_bag and taken away 
sarah stops at a gas_station in the deserts of mexico six months later already well into her pregnancy and is debating to herself whether or not she should ever tell john who his father is eventually she decides that she will reflecting that kyle deserves to be remembered for his sacrifice and contribution although kyle reese died not knowing that he was john connors father john himself would know just then a young mexican boy takes sarahs picture with a kodamatic camera and gives the developed photo to her it is the same photo connor eventually gives to reese 
in terminator judgement day michael biehn reprised the role of kyle reese sarah connor under heavy sedation imagines him visiting her in a mental_institution unchanged from his appearance in the first film he embraces her and implores her to go to their sons aid reminding her that the future is not set in this dream_scene kyle is aware of the fact that he is johns father despite the fact he didnt know of it in real_life this scene was removed for the original theatrical release but restored to the extended_editions released
in the television_show terminator the sarah connor chronicles he is born in before the events of judgment day in this altered timeline
in the episode queens gambit it is revealed that kyle had an older brother named derek brian austin green who was also a resistance_soldier
actor jonathan jackson portrayed kyle reese in the episode of the first season dungeons dragons which detailed of the last days of what happened of how he and his brother are separated during a recon_mission before he made_his_trip through time to protect sarah connor and later on the episode of the second season goodbye to all that during dereks recollection of the future war
he is also played by skyler gisondo as an eight year old version of the character in the beginning of the episode of what he beheld in the final episode of the first season what he beheld derek reese takes a now years old john connor out for ice_cream as it is his birthday as they are watching two boys play_baseball the younger boy drops the ball and it rolls over to john john picks it up and hands it to him as he and derek are watching john finds the older boy strangely familiar and when he turns around john sees what is written on the back of his shirt reese john realizes that derek took him to see a five year old version of kyle and eleven year old version of derek before telling john that he figured out that kyle is johns dad as whenever i look at you i see him plus your moms his type
in the episode goodbye to all that during one of dereks recollections of the future war kyle when he was a corporal and a small group of his unit attempted to save forty prisoners included general john connor from skynets forces however he became trapped and one of the resistances senior_officers martin bedell sacrifices his life to save him and free skynets prisoners derek mentions to john that kyle might have been traumatized when he watched his best friend die after carrying him to an aid_station derek also tells john of his brothers fondness for using powerful incendiary_armor_piercing_rounds against hunter killers during the brothers period of hiding after judgment day derek killed a deer for food however kyle convinced him that it was unfair for them to eat the animal and reese buried the deer instead in the episode the demon hand its hinted at by sarah to derek reese that kyles remains have been cremated and scattered in the grass
a mental image of kyle reese appeared to a wounded sarah in the episode the good wound throughout the episode her image of kyle guides her in finding medical_treatment for herself along with getting help from derek reese kyles brother
in the season two finale born to run john is led by catherine weaver to an alternate post judgement day timeline where john connor has never led the resistance due to the displacement from his present there he encounters his father for the first time alongside derek reese and allison young
kyle reese is portrayed as a teenager by anton yelchin in terminator salvation the film takes_place in and it revolves around his first meeting with his future son john christian bale as a teenager kyle was the leader of the los angeles resistance_cell even though this only consisted of two people because of this he aspires to join the formal resistance_regulars who mark themselves with a red stripe on their left sleeve once he has earned it it is clear that kyle is immediately drawn to the charismatic figure of john connor due to the fact that he leaves his los angeles base immediately after hearing the latters resistance_broadcast inspired by connors example he frequently quotes segments of the broadcasts and adapts strategies that connor suggests for taking down terminators he similarly shares a unique bond with marcus wright sam worthington who helps hone kyles strategies in close quarters combat whereas kyles lectures on what humans are fighting for reminds marcus of his humanity
in the film kyles father had initially survived judgment day but died prior to the events of the movie and kyle is the primary target of skynet due to its awareness that he would eventually travel through time to and father john connor in the film kyle is already working with and protecting a child named star jadagrace berry when the two later save marcus wright from a t attack in the ruins of los angeles after skynet captures him outside of la reese upon escaping later worked with his future son building a bomb to destroy skynets san francisco command the two also fought one of the first t models together during this time connor took reese into the resistance with star granting him the promotion to tech com regular kyle and john have begun developing a friendship as mentioned in the first film evidenced by the way in which kyles promotion signified by inheriting johns tactical_jacket with red stripe comes alongside his joining of johns inner_circle at the end of the film
it was originally scripted that reese and another soldier named sumner were sent to protect sarah from the terminator but sumner died upon arriving after the time_portal fused him into a fire_escape the sequels show the time_displacement_field melting whatever object is in the way in the original script reese says to dr silberman the terminator had already gone through connor sent two of us to intercept it then zeroed the whole place but sumner didnt make it sumner would later appear in a sarah connor chronicles episode and make it alive through the time_portal with kyles brother and two other resistance time_traveling agents 
a still shot of kyle reese was used as the basis for a pose_held by solid snake on the box_art for the msx game metal gear right down to the gear he is wearing arnold schwarzenegger was the original choice to play reese while director james cameron intended to use a thinner more ordinary_looking actor as the terminator his first choice being lance henriksen upon meeting schwarzenegger cameron decided to cast him as the terminator instead and henriksen was made a police_detective however cameron would revisit this idea when he cast robert patrick as the t in the sequel 
michael biehn almost did not get the role of reese because at his audition he spoke in a southern accent after having just auditioned for a role in a stage_production of cat on a hot tin roof earlier that day and couldnt shake the accent and the producers did not want reese to seem regionalized after biehns agent explained this to the producers he got a second audition and won the part the original scriptment gave reeses age as while a later draft gave his age as in real_life biehn was years old at the time that he was cast as reese

loaded known as blood factory in japan is a science_fiction themed top_down shoot em up video_game that was developed by gremlin interactive and published by interplay loaded was released in late early around new_year time on both the playstation and sega saturn the game had origins in dc comics and more notably the more adult orientated vertigo comics and there was a small graphic_novel based on the game the six playable characters of the game are a combination of villains anti heroes psychopaths perverts mutants and flamboyant murderers they are however the last hope to stop_the intergalactic supervillain code named fub and save the universe the characters were created and designed with contributions from garth ennis of vertigo comics and greg staples of ad
later in the same year the game spawned a sequel using almost entirely the same characters and the same game_engine albeit one with mildly improved graphics named re loaded re loaded was released on the playstation and pc at the end of although it did not enjoy as good sales as its predecessor it did however have_an acclaimed soundtrack which included music from pop will eat itself as did the first game and the game_discs of both games could be played as audio_cds both games were notorious for their macabre sense_of_humor over the top_violence and extreme gore
loaded was developed by gremlin interactive a british software_house based in sheffield which had previously had_a_successful_run in developing games loaded and its sequel re loaded would be among the last games developed by gremlin interactive before it was acquired by french giant infogrames for million and the studio in sheffield closed the game was internationally published by american based interplay
loaded was an interesting marketing_gimmick when released considering that the main_character_design and graphics were done by a host of comic_book_illustrators like les spink and greg staples of ad fame the games_publisher interplay collaborated with dc comics batman superman doom patrol to create a small page novella illustrated with the games artwork to promote it and introduce the characters and the game_premise the book was published bundled with dcs works at the time and dc signed adult orientated vertigo comics star garth ennis preacher hellblazer hitman judge dredd etc to write it the novella is now considered a collectors item
the game is set in the distant future long after mankind has discovered faster than light flight and has since colonized most of the inhabitable worlds across the galaxy fub was once a pretty uncultured and incapable catering_officer with questionable sanity in the sector marines often screwing up the field_kitchens and dropping jars of plusgrial fnart_jiz_powder into the cooking_pot fub which stands fat ugly boy a name he was never able to escape finally lost his mind on a barren desert_front during a relatively minor skirmish of the last years not wanting to let the boys down and unable to find any meat fub amputated his own legs cooked them and served them up to the soldiers in a hot broth despite it being the best dish he had ever created fub was given_an_unconditional_discharge and asked never to show his face again vowing to get_revenge on the worlds_of_man for his banishment and exile fub replaces his legs with mechanical hydraulic powered replacements and becomes a feared and egotistical space_pirate attracting other fragile minds to his cause he undertakes a dramatic bizarre and insane appearance wearing furry dice smoking havana cigars and tattooing a target on his portly belly
the six playable characters have notable differences and derangements but what they have in common is that they are all psychotic mercenaries who have been framed for crimes actually committed by fub and are now serving life_sentences on an inhospitable maximum_security_prison_planet the planet raulf fub has even taken on a new secretive identity joining the intergalactic prison_system and working his way up the ladder by murdering his superiors and taking_their positions and fub is now the warden of raulf fub has done this so that he can pin his crimes as a space_pirate on other people usually those who are psychotic anyway so as nobody will notice
the player or two of the games six characters in two player mode must escape raulf chase fub and engage on a bloody odyssey across the strange worlds of the galaxy to exact revenge on fub the supervillain however is merely excited by this seeing it as a challenge and a game and to this end he steals the most advanced machine in existence a machine which can toy with the very fabric of the universe manipulate matter and even open doorways to other dimensions with this machine fub plans to hold_the universe to ransom and sets up a prison_break on raulf to set_things_in motion if he can defeat a group of the most feared individuals in the galaxy who are armed to the teeth and wanting revenge he figures he can defeat anyone
the game features levels across fifteen different worlds and has six playable characters mamma fwank bounca vox butch and capn hands two characters may be selected in co operative mode to complete the game a mission briefing will begin at the start of every mission aided by a full motion_video_sequence loadeds gameplay is similar to that of gauntlet which requires the player to move room to room killing everything in sight everything of which will try to kill the player also score can be increased by looting the bloodied remains of enemies there are some puzzle and exploration_elements and power ups and ammo can be found the levels progress by collecting keycards capable of unlocking doors the player can zoom in to their character by pressing r or zoom out by pressing l at the end of each level the game tallies the players greed_factor accuracy and body_count on a scale in order to give the players career prospects ranging from as low as social_worker to as high as genocidal_maniac etc and final score
loaded features compositions by neil biggin plus tracks by patrick pat phelan and more by pop will eat itself kick to kill and rsvp the game was specially designed so that it could be placed inside a cd_player and used as an audio_cd skipping track which contained the code for the game this would then enable the listener to play the full soundtrack including many hidden_tracks there are audio_tracks in total on the cd the hidden_tracks were brief demos and were never used in game
the game received mixed reviews with critics noting that it wasnt exactly a cerebral_game but with others noting that it was nonetheless fun and addictive critics are still divided even today which is evident in the reviews of the game on the gamefaqs website however the general consensus was positive and loaded currently has an rating on mobygames
loaded was noted in many reviews for its violence everything living encountered by the player must be killed often resulting in explosions of gore on june loaded was put on the infamous german index by the bpjs
the largest character in the game a veritable giant mammas real name is unknown and wears a diaper baby_bonnet wooley hat and bunny_slippers however both the guards and prisoners of the raulf prison_planet are all terrified of him due the fact he has a tendency to crush to death anybody who comes near him in a mammoth bone cruching organ bursting bear_hug which to mamma is an innocent gesture of friendship he then believes the crushed bodies are asleep and he will go off looking for his next cuddle mamma was abandoned as a babe in the busiest star_port in the galaxy a place where nobody has any time for anybody else he is totally without education manners and most of all the other things which are generally regarded as civilized he blunders through life using his very limited vocabulary to get him through all manner of circumstance the only word he knows and the only thing that keeps him going is the word mamma lending him his name obviously he missed something as an infant his lineage is therefore something of an unknown quantity but one thing is certain his mother was friendly with something large and simian quite a scary and unpredictable man to have around even if you are scary and unpredictable yourself mammas weapon is the plasma gun and his bomb is the ripple grenade used when mamma creates a wave through the ground that instantly kills a large amount of foes around him this attack can travel through walls and doors mamma has a very good armor_rating but a slow speed
featured on the cover of the game fwank is a very heavily built and thoroughly psychotic man donning a bank_bag over his face with the bag painted making him resemble a clown almost child like in demeanour although not so much as mamma he has a notable lisp which causes him to mis pronounce words rs are substituted with ws providing his nickname fwank killed his parents and his pwobation_officer when he was young and the graphic_novel explains that he was lobotomized at age six although his true name is never revealed his body is described as that of a steroid eating wilderbeest who doesnt shower fwank looks upon other lifeforms as toys for his amusement or worse expendable cardboard_targets at a fairground_attraction the only things he cares about is his collection of teddy_bears especially the one he calls percy and keeping his weapon well_oiled fwank makes_one_concession to his fellow_lifeforms he ties a mood_balloon to his back_pack indicating the general ballpark of his demeanour green for chuckly yellow for i need space and red for i wouldnt ask if i were you fwanks weapon of choice is a cannon that fires neutron spheres and his bombs are homing_teddies a floating armada of teddy_bears containing explosives that eviscerate nearby foes this attack can kill enemies stationed directly behind a door but cannot travel through walls and doors however the teddies can follow fwank and stay in use longer to attack incoming enemies fwank has stats almost similar to mamma fwank has a good armor_rating but a slow speed
not quite as big as mamma the tuxedo wearing bounca is nonetheless a mammoth of a man and still towers over most other lifeforms he has spent his adult_life as a security_guard personal_bodyguard and mostly as a bouncer certainly one of the most widely_travelled and employed organisms in the history of the galaxy he has seen amazing sights that even the most intrepid galactic explorers would go_green at hidden planets lost continents and the like bounca has a slight problem though he is incredibly thick not just a bit thick enormously thick all of his experiences amount to a big fat zero because the only thing he finds interesting is slappin some innocent geeza about a bit you might as well have sent a baboon around the galaxy and then questioned it about its experiences as it is probably more perceptive and definitely less likely to kill you for asking he lost his lower jaw fighting an alien monster twice as big as him who was trying to enter a doorway bounca was watching over bounca won the fight but had to have his lower jaw replaced with a giant metallic serrated muzzle his weapon is a missile launcher and his bomb is the frag missile a randomly moving burst of shrapnel this attack can not travel through walls and doors the all rounder of the group in stats bounca has a medium armor_rating and a moderate speed
the only female in the game vox is a former sound_engineer disc_jockey and glamour_model often called the siren due to her mixed beauty and extremely sharp tongue and temper and overall devastating sexy countenance vox uses modified sound and music_technology to kill foes in the game self_developed with the aid of gabbist monks an order who take_the_vow to never have a seconds peace and quiet and are masters in the art of amplification the device they collaborated on is slung across her back and has a number of rapmaster microphones channelling sound to it via boom_mikes on her visor the sound_waves created act as shock_waves and are capable of turning voxs enemies into bubbling pools of protoplasm her weapon is the hail flail and her ultra_bomb is the sonic blast an extremely potent and charged burst of lethal sound_waves this attack can travel through walls and doors vox is small and light with a poor armor_rating but is the fastest character in speed making it easy for her to even dodge bullets
a muscular balding transvestite man that wears ladies_dresses in combat and dislikes those that find his cross dressing funny he brutally murders anybody who snickers at his attire the game_manual and also the graphic_novel explain that it is not through choice however every time he escapes he simply grabs the nearest item to hand which unfortunately by a staggering twist_of_fate always happens to be womens clothing in some form butchs favoured weapon is a flamethrower named the flaming queen and his bomb is the explosive ring the release of fireballs in all directions within butchs radius this attack can travel through walls and doors instead of splattering enemies into a bloody heap the flaming queen and the explosive ring actually chars enemies bodies on contact he has a medium armor_rating and fast speed although not as fast as vox making him the second fastest character in the game
a pirate like character with freakishly large hands and forearms a cowboy_hat and an exposed ribcage capn hands has been around for centuries and nothing is known of his origins although the rumors range from being a pirate who was operating in the caribbean during the golden_age of piracy of the late s or even a cowboy from the old american west of the s up until recently before he was captured by the authorities capn hands was a leader of the feared and despised cirates a group of cybernetically enhanced space_pirates only his head is an original part of his human_body and that too is rotten to the core the rest of his powerful frame is an old and out of date cyborg_design which he could have replaced over years ago when technology took_a_giant_leap forward but he likes it another reason he keeps this ancient and obsolete skeleton is for its amazing array of original art and engravings which decorate the majority of its panels showing his numerous exploits and stories through space he has kept the inmates of raulf prison amused and beguiled for hours on end with stories of how he acquired them and with his famous dancing bare lady design only his close_friends and people who are about to expire horribly generally get to see that though the truth is capn hands cannot remember who he was before he became a cybernetic skeletal pirate simply because it was so long ago and his mind isnt what it used to be his weapons are a pair of old flintlock_muskets which he has customized for rapid energy_fire although he has made sure they still retain their trademark_sound of old his bomb is the vortex bomb a curtain of dark_energy that shreds enemies to pieces this attack can travel through walls and doors capn hands has an average armor_rating and moderate speed being the third fastest character behind vox and butch

on june re loaded was put on the infamous german index by the bpjs like its predecessor
the lyceum ancient greek lykeion was a gymnasium and public meeting_place in classical athens named after the god of the grove that housed the lyceum apollo lyceus apollo was also the greek wolf god though best_known for its connection with aristotle and the peripatetic_school he led there the lyceum was in existence long before aristotles formal founding in or bc and continued under several heads until the roman general sulla sacked athens in bc the remains of the lyceum were discovered in modern athens in 
speculation suggests that pericles or pisistratus may have originally opened the first building of the lyceum as a gymnasium in the fifth or sixth centuries bc though the lyceum grounds would have predated the gymnasium in the early years of the lyceum the head of the greek army was said to have had an office there which would have made it easy for him to be involved in the military_training and exercises which the grounds were used for the lyceums use as a recreational_gym and military_training base is supported by the existence of wrestling_rings a racetrack and seats for athlothetai the judges of athletic events 
a long list of philosophers and sophists gave_talks at the lyceum prior to aristotle including prodicus of ceos protagoras and rhapsodes the most famous philosophers to have taught there however were isocrates plato of the academy and the best_known athenian teacher socrates in addition to military_training and educational pursuits the lyceum also housed athenian assembly meetings before the pnyx became the official meeting_place in the fifth century bc cult_practices_of_various_groups_were_also_held at the lyceum
in bc athens fell under macedonian rule and aristotle aged returned from asia upon his return to athens aristotle began teaching regularly in the morning in the lyceum and founded an official school the lyceum after his morning_lessons aristotle would frequently lecture on the grounds for the public and manuscripts of his compiled lectures were eventually circulated the group of scholars who followed the aristotelian doctrine came to be known as the peripatetics due to aristotles tendency to walk as he taught 
aristotles main foci as a teacher were cooperative_research an idea which he founded through his natural_history_work and systematic collection of philosophical works to contribute to his library his students were assigned historical or scientific_research_projects as part of their studies the school was also student_run the students elected a new student_administrator to work with the school_leadership every ten days allowing all the students to become involved in turn before returning to athens aristotle had been the tutor of alexander of macedonia who became the great conqueror alexander the great 
throughout his conquests of various regions alexander collected plant and animal_specimens for aristotles research allowing aristotle to develop the first zoo and botanical_garden in existence it is also suspected that alexander donated what would be the equivalent of more than million dollars to the lyceum in bc aristotle was forced to flee athens with his family when the political leadership reacted against the macedonians again and his previously published works supporting macedonian rule left him a target he passed on his lyceum to theophrastus and died later that year in chalcis near his hometown 
theophrastus placed a provision in his will that left the lyceum library which at this point included both his and aristotles work as well as student_research philosophical historical texts and histories of philosophy to his supposed follower neleus however the seniors of the lyceum placed strato as the next leader and upon his retirement from the school in the mid third century bc neleus divorced the lyceum from its library and took all of the books with him to skepsis in mysia 
the library then disappeared for several centuries until it appears to have been bought from neleus heirs in the first century bc and returned to the school however when sulla attacked athens the books were shipped to rome throughout their travels one fifth of aristotles works were lost and thus are not a part of the modern aristotelian collection still what did remain of aristotles works and the rest of the library were arranged and edited for school_use between and bc supposedly by andronicus of rhodes the lyceums eleventh leader since then the remaining works have been translated and widely distributed providing much of the modern knowledge of historic_philosophy
as head of the lyceum theophrastus continued aristotles foci of observation collaborative research and documentation of philosophical_history thus making_his_own_contributions to the library most notably as the first organizer of botany though he was not a citizen of athens he had met aristotle in the s in his homeland of lesbos he managed to buy land near the main gym of the lyceum as well as several buildings for the library and additional workspace in bc theophrastus also continued his own work while teaching and demonstrated his devotion to learning and education by leaving the land of the lyceum to his friends to continue their work in education in philosophy in the non private tradition of the school upon his death 
during the era of theophrastus and his successor strato of lampsacus the lyceum experienced a decline until it fell with the rest of athens in bc there is some thought that the lyceum was refounded in the first century ad by andronicus of rhodes and no matter its secondary founder it once again flourished as a philosophical_school in the second century and continued until athens was once again sacked in ad
theophrastus headed the lyceum for years between aristotles exile from athens in bc until his own death in bc there is some speculation that both aristotle and theophrastus were buried in the gardens of the lyceum though no graves have been positively identified theophrastus was followed by strato who served as head until lyco of troas likely aristo of ceos critolaus diodorus of tyre and erymneus were the next several heads of the school additionally andronicus of rhodes served as the eleventh head 
at various points in the history of the lyceum numerous scholars and students walked its parapetoi though some of the most notable include eudemus a mathematical_historian aristoxenus who wrote works on music and dicaearchus a prolific writer on topics including ethics politics psychology and geography additionally medicinal_historian meno and an eventual ruler of athens demetrius of phaleron spent time at the school demetrius of phaleron ruled athens as a proxy_leader for a dynasty from bc
during excavation to clear_space for athens new museum of modern art the remains of aristotles lyceum were uncovered descriptions from the works of ancient philosophers hint at the location of the grounds speculated to be somewhere just outside the eastern boundary of ancient athens near the rivers ilissus and eridanus and mount lykabettos which is just where the remains were found in present day athens the excavation_site is located between rigilis and vasilissis sofias yards from the british embassy and behind the war museum the first excavations revealed a gymnasium and wrestling_area but further work has uncovered the majority of what is believed to have withstood the erosion caused to the region by nearby architectures placement and drainage upon realizing the magnitude of the discovery beneath the parking_lot to be transformed into the museum secondary plans were made for nearby construction of the art_museum so that it could be combined with a lyceum outdoor_museum and give_tourists_easy_access to both attractions there are plans for a large outdoor_roof to be placed over the lyceum remains and the area was slated to open for the public in summer 
the manchester and salford yeomanry_cavalry was a short lived yeomanry_regiment formed in response to social unrest in northern england in the volunteer_regiment became notorious for its involvement in the peterloo massacre in which as many as people were killed and were injured often referred to simply as the manchester yeomanry the regiment was disbanded in 
after the end of the napoleonic wars in many textile_workers in the newly industrialised towns of northern england lost their jobs as a result of an economic_slump connected to the reduced need for war_materiel even for those still employed rising food_prices made life very difficult at the same time writers such as william cobbett were denouncing the inequity of the electoral_system as evidenced by rotten_boroughs poor mill_workers were a naturally sympathetic audience for a succession of radical organisers and speakers who spoke of electoral reform and alleviating poverty
this radical_movement deeply worried many supporters of the tory party particularly in northern england the fear of popular_revolt had begun with the american and french revolutions in the late th century many tory supporters such as mill_owners landowners and tradesmen saw the agitation for suffrage as little less than sedition the tory party strongly opposed the proposed reforms
on march about people met in st peters field in central manchester aiming to march to london to set their grievances before the prince_regent each person carried a rug or blanket leading them to be named blanketeers the march was quickly suppressed but manchester tories worried that they lacked protection from the hostile masses this fear spurred a petition with more than signatures to the boroughreeves and constables of manchester and salford demanding a meeting to establish a yeomanry_corps the constables organized the meeting for june wheelers manchester chronicle reported that those present resolved that under the present circumstances it is expedient to form a body of yeomanry_cavalry in the towns and neighborhood of manchester and salford the newspaper noted that government_allowances were available for uniforms and that if neighboring towns formed their own corps they might be later combined each man was to provide his own horse
thomas trafford owner of substantial lands in lancashire and cheshire was commissioned as the cavalrys first major commandant on august as with many yeomanry_regiments of the time it was a relatively inexperienced militia recruited from among shopkeepers and tradesmen a notice in the london gazette on october listed the appointment of officers to the corps over the past year

on august major trafford and lieutenant_colonel guy lestrange the overall military_commander in manchester were sent_notes by a magistrate william hulton urging them to dispatch troops to a public meeting on voting reform being addressed by the orator henry hunt
the notes were handed to two horsemen standing by the manchester and salford yeomanry were stationed just a short distance away in portland street and so received their note first trafford dispatched officers and men of the manchester and salford yeomanry who immediately drew their swords and galloped towards st peters field one trooper in a frantic attempt to catch up knocked down a woman in cooper street causing the death of her child when he was thrown from her arms two year old william fildes was the first casualty of peterloo special constables were already present at the meeting but no troops
sixty cavalrymen of the manchester and salford yeomanry led by captain hugh hornby birley a local factory_owner arrived at the house from where the magistrates were watching some reports allege that they were drunk andrews the chief_constable instructed birley that he had an arrest_warrant which he needed assistance to execute birley was asked to take his cavalry to the hustings to allow the speakers to be removed it was by then about pm major trafford himself appears not to have been present for the disastrous attack on the assembled crowd that followed
the route towards the hustings between the special constables was narrow and as the inexperienced horses were thrust further and further into the crowd they reared and plunged as people tried to get out of their way the arrest_warrant had been given to the deputy_constable joseph nadin who followed behind the yeomanry as the cavalry pushed towards the speakers_stand they became stuck in the crowd and in panic started to hack about them with their sabres on his arrival at the stand nadin arrested hunt johnson and a number of others including john tyas the reporter from the times according to tyas the yeomanrys progress through the crowd had provoked a hail of bricks and stones and caused them to lose all command of temper their mission to execute the arrest_warrant having been achieved they then set about destroying the banners and flags carried by the crowd
from his vantage_point william hulton perceived the unfolding events as an assault on the yeomanry and on lestranges arrival at pm at the head of his hussars he ordered them into the field to disperse the crowd with the words good god sir dont you see they are attacking the yeomanry disperse the meeting the th hussars formed themselves into a line stretching across the eastern end of st peters field and charged into the crowd at about the same time the cheshire yeomanry charged from the southern edge of the field at first the crowd had some difficulty in dispersing as the main exit_route into peter street was blocked by the th infantry regiment standing with bayonets fixed one officer of the th hussars was heard trying to restrain the by now out of control manchester and salford yeomanry who were cutting at every one they could reach for shame for shame gentlemen forbear forbear the people cannot get away within ten minutes the crowd was dispersed at the cost of at least dead and over injured
the government and landowners viewed the yeomanrys actions at peterloo as a courageous defence against insurrection following the massacre on august lord sidmouth sent a message of thanks from the prince_regent to major trafford among others however public horror at the actions of the yeomanry grew after the massacre major trafford resigned his commission in and the yeomanry_corps was disbanded on june

the former soviet republic of georgia has a monarchic tradition that traces its origins to the hellenistic_period the medieval kingdom of georgia ruled by the bagrationi dynasty has left behind a legacy that lasts in georgia even in modern_times the qualities and symbols associated with the bagrationi monarchy have been crucial in the making of the georgian nation and the subsequent construction of national_history their rule ended with the annexation of georgian lands by the russian empire early in the th century although several branches of the dynasty survive to this day the monarchic restoration was considered by various royalist groups throughout the th century although georgias politics has been taking_place in the framework of a presidential_republic since the nation regained its independence from the soviet union in the debate on monarchy particularly its constitutional_form has never actually ceased the issue came up most recently amid a political_crisis in late 
 
the russian empire absorbed the two principal georgian kingdoms those of kartli kakheti and imereti in and respectively the members of the dispossessed royal_dynasty fomented a series of rebellions against russian rule but all of them failed the russian administration using a combination of military_pacification and diplomatic persuasion succeeded in winning a degree of loyalty of local elites the bagrationi princes themselves subsequently bowed to the inevitable and reconciled with a fait_accompli
shortly after the decembrist revolt of royalist georgians in st petersburg and moscow urged on by the grandsons of the penultimate king of georgia erekle ii the princes okropir and dimitri tried to convince georgian students in the two russian cities that georgia should be independent under the bagrationi dynasty okropir visited tiflis in and helped found a secret_society with the aim of restoring the georgian monarchy inspired by the french revolution of and the polish insurrection of the conspirators were united in their anti russian sentiment but divided in their program although the majority favored a restoration of the bagrationi to the georgian throne the planned coup was prevented by the police in 
the loyalty of georgian nobility to the russian tsar won by liberal politics of the imperial viceroy prince vorontsov began to fade in the s yet after the georgian royalist led conspiracy in no georgian movement or political_party called for an outright independence until world war i
during the world war i years georgian migrs under the guidance of prince matchabelli established a national committee in berlin which considered a reinstatement of a monarchy in georgia under the german protectorate an influential lobby of the idea was otto von lossow who suggested putting the german prince joachim on the georgian throne however following the russian revolution of georgians restored their independent state in the form of a democratic_republic may the result of a long time domination of georgian political scene by social_democrats georgian nobility including the scions of the former royal_dynasty lent_their_support to a new republic as a contemporary western observer noted like that of france the georgian nobility has a social rather than a political significance the people are democratic in spirit there is not the least chance of a revival of monarchy in georgia and the nobles will hardly have more political weight than their individual merit entitles
the democratic_republic of georgia fell to soviet russias red army invasion in the subsequent political repressions especially during the abortive august uprising in forced many of the bagrationi family_members to flee the soviet union some of them died in purges
one of the migrs prince irakli of the house of mukhrani a collateral branch of the bagrationi dynasty tried to enlist the support of european powers for a georgian monarchist cause after settling in spain before the war prince irakli founded what he called the royal_house of georgia and sought support from european governments for a georgian monarchy independent from stalins soviet union when prince irakli died in spain in george became first in line to the royal_house of georgia and was recognised as such albeit as a formality by the government and parliament of the new independent republic in despite rival claims from others the legitimate rights of this house to the throne have frequently been questioned however due to the fact the patrilineal descendants of the last king of georgia the bagration gruzinsky still survive in georgia this line is currently represented by prince nugzar bagration gruzinsky born the heir_male of georgias last reigning king george xii however the two branches acted to resolve this conflict by uniting through the marriage of david of mukhrani with nugzars daughter anna in february 
as georgia was moving towards independence from the soviet union early in the s monarchical restoration was an issue on the fringes of politics but without actual candidates to a throne and popular_support for monarchy various georgian political groups tried to negotiate a return of jorge de bagration head of the royal_house of georgia and even sent a delegation to madrid to persuade the reluctant prince some political activists especially those associated with the national democratic party speculated that a constitutional_monarchy in georgia would help scotch any efforts by moscow to keep georgia inside the soviet union after georgias declaration_of_independence on april weak and fractious opposition_groups again raised_the_issue of restoration hoping to neutralize zviad gamsakhurdia the first popularly elected president of georgia and his authoritarian tendencies
during the rule of eduard shevardnadze no serious consideration_was_given to monarchist ideas although several minor political_parties including the union of georgian traditionalists led by the former parliamentary chairman akaki asatiani continued to advocate a constitutional_monarchy as a form of georgias government
the debate on a constitutional_monarchy was revitalized with the emerging political_crisis in georgia later in the october sermon of catholicos patriarch ilia ii the popular head of the georgian orthodox church gave_an_impetus to a renewed political debate the patriarch who has always sympathized with the idea of constitutional_monarchy said during his sunday service at the cathedral of the holy trinity that the restoration of the royal_dynasty was a desirable dream of the georgian people he also emphasized that if the people of georgia chose this model of governance a candidate to the crown should be selected among representatives of the royal_dynasty and he should be suitably raised to be king from childhood
the patriarchs sermon gave_an_unexpected_continuation to the political_crisis in georgia although the patriarchs sympathies towards the monarchy is not something new for the regular parish to hear several opposition_parties immediately seized on the opportunity to advance their slogan georgia without a president a reference to the model of parliamentary_rule advocated by the georgian opposition many politicians expressed their support to a constitutional_monarchy with a transitional stage in the form of a parliamentary_republic
the authorities response to the calls for a monarchy was restrained nino burjanadze a chairperson of the parliament of georgia has expressed skepticism about the idea and stated that georgia will not be able to decide on such an important issue until its territorial_integrity is restored referring to the secession in abkhazia and south ossetia president mikheil saakashvili having jokingly remarked on his remote bagratid ancestry said that serious considerations are necessary on this issue so that we do not add new problems to the already existing ones giga bokeria an influential member_of_the_parliament from saakashvilis united national movement tried to soft pedal the patriarchs statement the patriarch didnt suggest establishing monarchy today he meant this may happen after georgia resolves its fundamental problems he later alleged that the oppositions call for a constitutional_monarchy was merely a populist move they speak about constitutional_monarchy here and do not say anything about it abroad this is their double standard policy ilia ii himself has avoided further comment on the topic 
meanwhile the opposition new rights party which stood aside from the anti government demonstrations staged by a coalition of ten opposition_parties in october and november became the only major political group to add a more nuanced view on the establishment of a constitutional_monarchy to their agenda they issued a special declaration supporting the idea and proposing to hold_a_referendum on the issue a suggestion which was also included in the pre election_campaign of david gamkrelidze a candidate from the new rightsindustrialists bloc for the early presidential_elections held on january 
a monarchy_option has always caused an ambiguous resonance in georgia on the one hand the monarchy is considered a symbol of georgian unity and independence and on the other hand it belongs to a remote past with a significant gap of more than years in monarchic tradition thus according to one survey conducted back in only of respondents believed that a monarchy would be a good or very good form of government for georgia when asked how suitable they think various types of government were or would be for georgia there are no significant recent public_opinion surveys available though a small and limited internet_poll at the medianews agency website shows as of december only a support for monarchy critics point out that the wide majority of georgians do not have internet_service or participated in the survey and therefor reject the results
the skeptics say the restoration of the monarchy is technically impossible due to several reasons including the number of candidates and an unsettled question of succession to the georgian throne additionally they believe that the criteria for selecting the king will lead to major disagreements
the supporters of constitutional_monarchy continue to argue that this form of state would best protect the interests of citizens of georgia a monarch would reign not rule and act as a safeguard of stability and national_unity they see the return to monarchy as a historical justice referring to the fact that the native royal_dynasty has never been rejected or overthrown by the georgian people but was dispossessed by a foreign_power ie russia

targjei augundsson november better_known as myllarguten meaning the millerboy is arguably the most acknowledged norwegian folk_musician to this day and by far the most legendary
targjei was born in sauherad telemark the date of his birth is disputed the years range from to and some say his father augund was only registered as the father of the boy in the local church_documentation he married gunhild the mother in october targjei was already born at the time usually farmers of the norwegian serfdom_stock is not very well_documented often moving from homestead to homestead 
myllargutens father was a country_fiddler one of many at the time and targjei was going for the fiddle from early age but it is told he feared his father would beat him if he tried the instrument so he sneaked himself to playing while his father was outside and at work at the local mill his fathers profession gave targjei his name the millerboy one day the father returned early from work and heard someone inside playing and asked astonished who the player was his wife gunhild had to admit it was his son targjei from then on augund his father trained him but the boy was so eager his father had to give him away to other fiddlers in the area
amongst his teachers were the fiddlers knut lurs from tinn jon kjos from motsdal mattis flathus from sauherad and ystein langedrag from b the latter had been a soldier in the napoleonic wars and had some experience with military_music which influenced his style and to a degree the style of myllarguten the fiddler he regarded the best of his teachers was knut lurs one of two colleague_fiddlers he really appreciated as his reputation grew targjei was known as a hard critic and a merciless competitor he did not like to be bested at playing the other he held_in_esteem was hvard giben regarded as his traditional counterpart in folk_music from telemark hvard was the only fiddler of whom targjei would say he is the master of us all
life as a fiddler was a life on the road he soon got reputation and played from early on at weddings and county_feasts all over telemark he soon made_longer_journeys and spanned the country as far as bergen and gudbrandsdalen he eventually got married with ingebjrg eddandshaugen from vinje and had ten children by her of whom at least four sons became fiddlers themselves and through them the music from targjei has been passed on down to this day in telemark
myllarguten was a difficult person an imaginative musical_artist but painstakingly slow in all other tasks than playing he could use a day on matters other more practical persons finished in a couple of hours he was eager to learn dance tunes and turned them around in his own way making them longer and richer than before thus he laid_the_ground for a brand_new way of playing the hardanger_fiddle in telemark
in he met ole bull in bergen and became his friend_for_life bull was on a short visit between tours and was at the time looking for a personal and national expression he had not yet opened his mind for the rural_music but when hearing myllarguten he got exactly what he had looked for later he said there has not been a one fiddler that has made me content in such a way the two understood each other and soon became friends bull wrote down some of the tunes he heard and borrowed myllargutens fiddle and in turn played classical_music for the fiddler they both came enriched from the meeting and bull always played some norwegian folk_music on his concerts after this thus he made the rural tunes known to a larger public for the first time the meeting had_lasting_impact in the evolving romantic_nationalism in norway
after this meeting they did not meet again for years until bull endeavored to make_a_concert with myllarguten in christiania february when romantic_nationalism was at its very peak in norway the concert became a commercial success and the hall was packed with excited listeners among them some from telemark who had got free_tickets the known author aasmund olavsson vinje decided not to go afraid that the concert might go awry for the sensible fiddler and would not be held responsible as a man from the same district which he was 
when going_on_stage myllarguten had to break his crate open with a knife and was delayed several minutes this made him nervous and he started playing other tunes than the appointed but he soon played himself into ecstasy as was his wont and the audience cheered newspapers called him a true child_of_nature and praised him with eulogies and poems on the other hand the urban audience was more excited by the event than the music as the traditional music was and is a music for trained ears when the romantic wave died down myllarguten became a has been and was regarded as nothing more than a drunken telemark farmer
the concerts gave him money to raise a farm in rauland and the more experienced farmer rikard aslaksson berge helped him in this myllarguten had played at his wedding and was a regular guest at the farm thus his music was passed on to rikards sons and from them to his grandson eivind groven
in spite of his successes abroad targjei was not able to keep his money and had to leave his farm in the end the last years of his life he was tired of playing and became gradually harder to ask sometimes he became depressed and cursed both his fiddle and ole bull and all the rest he felt alone frustrated and lost but was still appreciated by his own community
myllarguten died a pauper in and his funeral was timid only one single boat and no flowers it was custom to travel to the church by water crossing the lake totak that was easier than taking_the road he is buried at the cemetery at rauland in telemark it was reckoned a pity that this should befall the greatest fiddler in norway but he is well_remembered and through his descendants passed on a vivid musical_tradition that lives on in telemark to this very day all the county honors his memory a memorial_stone was later set up at his grave
myllarguten was from the beginning a traditional folk_musician schooled and educated in local tradition the meeting with ole bull had_a_lasting_impact on his style and he began to explore the limits of his instrument i new and more advanced ways he also turned his tonality more towards the classical ideals rather than the more rural blue_note in carl schart an organist in bergen transcribed five of myllargutens tunes and those came_later_into print this example shows a vivid musical mind and a great performer
most of the sources for myllargutens life were written down from living memory accounted by people who had met the fiddler and his close relatives other sources exist as articles by romantic_nationalists in norway who met the fiddler and described him all the material was collected and edited by the folklorist rikard berge himself from telemark and grandson of rikard aslaksson as mentioned above he had first hand information and collected material for twelve years from to meeting many older people who remembered myllarguten thus he put together a thorough and useful biography and a valuable source

nova was a high_power laser built at the lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl in which conducted advanced inertial_confinement_fusion_icf_experiments until its dismantling in nova was the first icf_experiment built with the intention of reaching ignition a chain_reaction of nuclear_fusion that releases a large amount of energy although nova failed in this goal the data it generated clearly defined the problem as being mostly a result of magnetohydrodynamic instability leading to the design of the national ignition facility novas successor nova also generated considerable amounts of data on high density matter physics regardless of the lack of ignition which is useful both in fusion_power and nuclear_weapons_research
inertial_confinement_fusion_icf_devices use drivers to rapidly heat the outer layers of a target in order to compress it the target is a small spherical_pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion_fuel typically a mix of deuterium and tritium the heat of the laser burns the surface of the pellet into a plasma which explodes off the surface the remaining portion of the target is driven inwards due to newtons third law eventually collapsing into a small point of very high density the rapid blowoff also creates a shock_wave that travels towards the center of the compressed fuel when it reaches the center of the fuel and meets the shock from the other side of the target the energy in the shock_wave further heats and compresses the tiny volume around it if the temperature and density of that small spot can be raised high enough fusion_reactions will occur
the fusion_reactions release high energy particles some of which primarily alpha_particles collide with the high_density_fuel around it and slow down this heats the fuel further and can potentially cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuelhigh enough density and temperaturethis heating process can result in a chain_reaction burning outward from the center where the shock_wave started the reaction this is a condition known as ignition which can lead to a significant portion of the fuel in the target undergoing fusion and the release of significant amounts of energy
to date most icf_experiments have used lasers to heat the targets calculations show that the energy must be delivered quickly in order to compress the core before it disassembles as well as creating a suitable shock_wave the energy must also be focused extremely evenly across the targets outer surface in order to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core although other drivers have been suggested notably heavy_ions driven in particle_accelerators lasers are currently the only devices with the right combination of features
llnls history with the icf_program starts with physicist john nuckolls who predicted in that ignition could be achieved with laser_energies about kj while high gain would require energies around mj although this sounds very low_powered compared to modern machines at the time it was just beyond the state_of_the_art and led to a number of programs to produce lasers in this power_range
prior to the construction of nova llnl had designed and built a series of ever larger lasers that explored the problems of basic icf_design llnl was primarily interested in the ndglass laser which at the time was one of a very few high energy laser designs known llnl had decided early on to concentrate on glass_lasers while other facilities studied gas_lasers using carbon_dioxide eg antares laser los alamos national laboratory or krf eg nike laser naval research laboratory building large ndglass_lasers had not been attempted before and llnls early research focussed primarily on how to make these devices
one problem was the homogeneity of the beams even minor variations in intensity of the beams would result in self focusing in the air and glass_optics in a process known as kerr_lensing the resulting beam included small filaments of extremely high light_intensity so high it would damage the glass_optics of the device this problem was solved in the cyclops laser with the introduction of the spatial_filtering technique cyclops was followed by the argus laser of greater power which explored the problems of controlling more than one beam and illuminating a target more evenly all of this work culminated in the shiva laser a proof of concept design for a high_power_system that included separate laser_amplifiers that were directed around the target to illuminate it
it was during experiments with shiva that another serious unexpected problem appeared the infrared_light generated by the ndglass_lasers was found to interact very strongly with the electrons in the plasma created during the initial heating through the process of stimulated raman_scattering this process referred to as hot electron pre heating carried away a great amount of the lasers energy and also caused the core of the target to heat before it reached maximum compression this meant that much less energy was being deposited in the center of the collapse both due to the reduction in implosion_energy as well as the outward force of the heated core although it was known that shorter wavelengths would reduce this problem it had earlier been expected that the ir_frequencies used in shiva would be short enough this proved not to be the case
a solution to this problem was explored in the form of efficient frequency_multipliers optical_devices that combine several photons into one of higher energy and thus frequency these devices were quickly introduced and tested experimentally on the omega laser and others proving effective although the process is only about efficient and half the original laser_power is lost the resulting ultraviolet_light couples much more efficiently to the target_plasma and is much more effective in collapsing the target to high density
with these solutions in hand llnl decided to build a device with the power needed to produce ignition_conditions design started in the late s with construction following shortly starting with the testbed novette laser to validate the basic beamline and frequency_multiplier_design this was a time of repeated energy_crises in the us and funding was not difficult to find given the large amounts of money available for alternative_energy and nuclear_weapons_research

during the initial construction_phase nuckolls found an error in his calculations and an october review chaired by john foster jr of trw confirmed that there was no way nova would reach ignition the nova design was then modified into a smaller design that added frequency_conversion to nm light which would increase coupling_efficiency the new nova emerged as a system with ten laser_amplifiers or beamlines each beamline consisted of a series of ndglass amplifiers separated by spatial_filters and other optics for cleaning up the resulting beams although techniques for folding the beamlines were known as early as shiva they were not well_developed at this point in time nova ended up with a single fold in its layout and the laser_bay containing the beamlines was long to the casual observer it appears to contain twenty long beamlines but due to the fold each of the ten is actually almost long in terms of optical_path_length
prior to firing the ndglass amplifiers are first pumped with a series of xenon_flash_lamps surrounding them some of the light produced by the lamps is captured in the glass leading to a population_inversion that allows for amplification via stimulated emission this process is quite inefficient and only about to of the power fed into the lamps is actually turned into laser_energy in order to produce the sort of laser_power required for nova the lamps had to be very large fed power from a large bank of capacitors located under the laser_bay the flash also generates a large amount of heat which distorts the glass requiring time for the lamps and glass to cool before they can be fired again this limits nova to about six firings a day at the maximum
once pumped and ready for firing a small pulse of laser_light is fed into the beamlines the ndglass disks each dump additional power into the beam as it passes through them after passing through a number of amplifiers the light_pulse is cleaned up in a spatial_filter before being fed into another series of amplifiers at each stage additional optics were used to increase the diameter of the beam and allow the use of larger and larger amplifier_disks in total nova contained fifteen amplifiers and five filters of increasing size in the beamlines with an option to add an additional amplifier on the last stage although it is not clear if these were used in practice
from there all ten beams pass into the experiment_area at one end of the laser_bay here a series of mirrors reflects the beams to impinge in the center of the bay from all angles optical_devices in some of the paths slow the beams so that they all reach the center at the same time within about a picosecond as some of the beams have longer paths to the center than others frequency_multipliers upconvert the light to green and blue uv just prior to entering the target_chamber nova is arranged so any remaining ir or green light is focused short of the center of the chamber
the nova laser as a whole was capable of delivering approximately kilojoules of infrared_light at nm or kilojoules of frequency_tripled light at nm the third harmonic of the ndglass fundamental line at nm in a pulse_duration of about to nanoseconds and thus was capable of producing a uv_pulse in the range of trillion watts
research on nova was focussed on the indirect_drive approach where the laser shine on the inside surface of a thin metal_foil typically made of gold lead or another high z metal when heated by the laser the metal re radiates this energy as diffuse x rays which are more efficient than uv at compressing the fuel_pellet in order to emit x rays the metal must be heated to very high temperatures which uses up a considerable amount of the laser_energy so while the compression is more efficient the overall energy delivered to the target is nevertheless much smaller the reason for the x ray conversion is not to improve energy_delivery but to smooth the energy_profile since the metal_foil spreads out the heat somewhat the anisotropies in the original laser are greatly reduced
the foil_shells or hohlraums are generally formed as small open ended cylinders with the laser arranged to shine in the open ends at an oblique angle in order to strike the inner surface in order to support the indirect_drive research at nova a second experimental_area was built past the main one opposite the laser_bay the system was arranged to focus all ten beams into two sets of five each which passed into this second area and then into either end of the target_chamber and from there into the hohlraums
confusingly the indirect_drive approach was not made widely public until documents from the era published in general science_magazines and similar material either gloss over the issue or imply that nova was using the direct_drive_approach lacking the hohlraum it was only during the design of nif that the topic become public so nova was old news by that point
as had happened with the earlier shiva nova failed to meet_expectations in terms of fusion_output in this case the problem was tracked to instabilities that mixed the fuel during collapse and upset the formation and transmission of the shock_wave the maximum fusion_yield on nova was about neutrons per shot the problem was caused by novas inability to closely match the output_energy of each of the beamlines which meant that different areas of the pellet received different amounts of heating across its surface this led to hot_spots on the pellet which were imprinted into the imploding plasma seeding rayleightaylor_instabilities and thereby mixing the plasma so the center did not collapse uniformly
nevertheless nova remained a useful instrument even in its original form and the main target_chamber and beamlines were used for many years even after it was modified as outlined below a number of different techniques for smoothing the beams were attempted over its lifetime both to improve nova as well as better understand nif these experiments added considerably not only to the understanding of icf but also to high density physics in general and even the evolution of the galaxy and supernovas
shortly after completion of nova modifications were made to improve it as an experimental_device one problem was that the experimental_chamber_took_a_long_time to refit for another shot longer than the time needed to cool down the lasers
in order to improve utilization of the laser a second experimental_chamber was built past the original with optics that combined the ten beamlines into two nova had been built up against the older shiva buildings with the two experimental_chambers back to back and the beamlines extending outward from the center target_areas the two_beam_system was installed by passing the beamguides and related optics through the now unused shiva experimental_area and placing the smaller experimental_chamber in shivas beam_bay
novas partial success combined with other experimental numbers prompted department of energy to request a custom military icf_facility they called the laboratory microfusion facility lmf that could achieve fusion_yield between and mj based on the lasnex computer_models it was estimated that lmf would require a driver of about mj in spite of nuclear_tests that suggested a higher power building such a device was within the state_of_the_art but would be expensive on the order of billion llnl returned a design with a mj nm uv driver_laser that would be able to reach about mj yield which was enough to access the majority of the lmf goals the program was estimated to cost about million fy dollars and an additional million to upgrade it to a full mj if needed and would grow to well over billion if lmf was to meet_all_of_the_goals the doe asked for other labs also proposed their own lmf designs using other technologies
faced with this enormous project in national academy of sciences conducted a second review of the us icf efforts on behalf of the us congress the report concluded that considering the extrapolations required in target_physics and driver_performance as well as the likely billion cost the committee believes that an lmf ie a laser microfusion facility with yields to one gigajoule is too large a step_to_take directly from the present program their report suggested that the primary goal of the program in the short term should be resolving the various issues related to ignition and that a full scale lmf should not be attempted until these problems were resolved the report was also critical of the gas_laser_experiments being carried out at lanl and suggested they and similar projects at other labs be dropped the report accepted the lasnex numbers and continued to approve an approach with laser_energy around mj nevertheless the authors were aware of the potential for higher energy_requirements and noted indeed if it did turn out that a mj driver were required for ignition and gain one would have to rethink the entire approach to and rationale for icf
in july llnl responded to these suggestions with the nova upgrade which would reuse the majority of the existing nova facility along with the adjacent shiva facility the resulting system would be much lower power than the lmf concept with a driver of about to mj the new design included a number of features that advanced the state_of_the_art in the driver_section including the multi pass design in the main amplifiers and beamlines up from that were split into beamlets as they entered the target_area in order to improve the uniformity of illumination the plans called for the installation of two main banks of laser_beamlines one in the existing nova beamline_room and the other in the older shiva building next_door extending through its laser_bay and target_area into an upgraded nova target_area the lasers would deliver about tw in a ns pulse the upgrades were expected to allow the new nova to produce fusion_yields between and mj the initial estimates from estimated construction_costs around million with construction taking_place from to 
for reasons that are not well_recorded in the historical record later in llnl updated their nova upgrade proposal and stated that the existing novashiva buildings would no longer be able to contain the new system and that a new building about three times as large would be needed from then on the plans evolved into the current national ignition facility
starting in the late s a new method of creating very short but very high_power_laser_pulses was developed known as chirped_pulse_amplification or cpa starting in llnl staff modified one of novas existing arms to build an experimental cpa_laser that produced up to pw known simply as petawatt it operated until when nova was dismantled to make_way for nif
the basic amplification_system used in nova and other high_power lasers of its era was limited in terms of power_density and pulse_length one problem was that the amplifier_glass responded over a period of time not instantaneously and very short pulses would not be strongly amplified another problem was that the high_power_densities led to the same sorts of self focusing problems that had caused problems in earlier designs but at such a magnitude that even measures like spacial_filtering would not be enough in fact the power_densities were high enough to cause filaments to form in air
cpa avoids both of these problems by spreading out the laser_pulse in time it does this by reflecting a relatively multi chromatic as compared to most lasers pulse off a series of two diffraction_gratings which splits them spatially into different frequencies essentially the same thing a simple prism does with visible light these individual frequencies have to travel different distances when reflected back into the beamline resulting in the pulse being stretched out in time this longer pulse is fed into the amplifiers as normal which now have time to respond normally after amplification the beams are sent into a second pair of gratings in reverse to recombine them into a single short pulse with high_power in order to avoid filamentation or damage to the optical elements the entire end of the beamline is placed in a large vacuum_chamber
although petawatt was instrumental in advancing the practical basis for the concept of fast_ignition_fusion by the time it was operational as a proof of concept device the decision to move ahead with nif had already been taken further work on the fast_ignition_approach continues and will potentially reach a level of development far in advance of nif at hiper an experimental_system under development in the european union if successful hiper should generate fusion_energy over twice that of nif while requiring a laser_system of less than one quarter the power and one tenth the cost fast_ignition is one of the more promising approaches to fusion_power
when nova was being dismantled to make_way for nif the target_chamber was lent to france for temporary use during the development of laser megajoule a system similar to nif in many ways this loan was controversial as the only other operational laser at llnl at the time beamlet a single experimental beamline for nif had recently been sent to sandia national laboratory in new mexico this left llnl with no large laser_facility until nif started operation which was then estimated as being at the earliest work on nif was not declared formally completed until march 

odo b stade july march was born in krautheim germany now saint louis alsace and was a resident of glendora california and renowned scholar his life included a career as navy_lieutenant charge_daffaires in mexico activist author poet actor stunt_pilot manager and owner of the hollywood bookstore linguist teacher and world_traveler his challenging and rewarding life brought_him_in_contact with many parts of the world many professions and people from all walks_of_life
odo was the first of eight children of one of the oldest family_clans in hungary stade ab palffy as a child he spent six months of the year in strassburg and the other six months in the wealthy familys country_place at trentschen teplitz hungary there was a great_estate in hungary with a tremendous stand of virgin_forest and a hunting_lodge in the tartara mountains which russia aqcuired after world war ii the place in budapest was years old and the family had a little palace in vienna
palffy was the family_name on odos grandmothers side she was a good friend of the empress elizabeth grandmother palffy played duets with liszt odos known family_history goes back to his paternal grandmother was a von scheele educated mainly in england it was her brother who in took the blind king from hanover to vienna on horseback to save his life when hanover ceased to be a kingdom after this feat_of_bravery this brother was made a director of the spanish riding institute which still exists they ride their mounts in chandeliered halls of the hofburg one time imperial castle of the habsburgs it was exiled during the occupation and only recently returned to vienna odos father was a friend of his uncle mothers brother and in he went to see him at the riding_school and there he met ilka ab palffy in they were married in 
odos mother was hungarian the family_name was szechenye his father was norwegian flemish and french and his name was de stade he was a surgeon and worked on the development and perfection of twilight_sleep odos mother thus married a commoner a surgeon and the family cut her off
when the first son odo was born the uncle brought the family together and odo was designated to take on the name of palffy when he became of age this is why he spent six months in hungary each year learning the ancestral traditions and the family_ways
the de stade family was musical one sister played the viola odos mother played the piano beautifully and sang odo played the violin and played in symphony_concerts before he was sixteen
odo wanted to become a doctor but his father objected at the age of odo recalls that he assisted his father in an emergency_operation after being awakened in the night during the last ten years of his life odos father was the court_surgeon he died at the age of on a visit to his sisters home in brazil
odo was given_instruction by a tutor who remained with him until he was ready to go to the university where he majored in philology
odo graduated cum laude when only fifteen and was able to join the naval academy in at pola during these years and the subsequent years as naval_lieutenant he saw much of the world including north and south america
following his uncles wish he resigned from the navy in and joined the austro hungarian foreign office at the end of november odo received_orders to leave for mexico as charg_daffaires the austrian minister had been absent from mexico city since early in and odo had the ungrateful task of creating order out of chaos a condition aggravated by the revolution in that unhappy country
having seen the peon_system in hungary he believed it was even worse in mexico sympathizing with the commoner odo was against huerta the new dictator so he joined the opposition francisco pancho villa the underdog now employed by the international cartel french owned international company of mines and exploration odo entered_into_an_agreement with villa if villa permitted his gold_shipments to leave the troubled country odo would represent villa in securing munitions and supplies for the rebel_forces
as villas purchasing_agent charged with developing an air_force his job sent him back and forth across the border to purchase guns ammunition and all the material_essentials for villas soldiers horses and vehicles odo managed to ship million in gold_bullion from the country before he had to leave mexico during this time he met most of the leaders and generals among them carranza felipe angeles governor jos mara maytorena c and made_numerous_trips to washington to consult with ambassador dumba president wilson personally consulted with odo during some of these trips to learn about the progress of villa
odo was wounded twice and once had his knee shot to pieces before the revolution was over he left mexico suffering from typhoid_malaria and in a desperate physical_condition illness and wounds forced odo to go to california in order to regain his health it was during this last escape to california that odo brought with him many of villas personal effects including a pair of boots saddle rifle and colt revolver which he gave to young michael rubel builder of rubel castle in glendora in the s
upon arriving in california odo called on mr adam clark vroman famous photographer and prominent bookseller of pasadena california mr vroman offered to employ him as a clerk in his store odo accepted the kind offer and remained with vromans books for some six months when he was forced to quit his job by his lingering illness
his doctor recommended living in the wild so in may odo hiked to tahoe and on to the high sierras where he lived off the land for six months he had weighed only pounds when he left for the mountains and when he came back he weighed during this phase he helped establish the altitudes of many of the sierra peaks
upon his return from the sierras odo accepted encouraged by mr vroman the managership of the hollywood bookstore then owned by mr frederick g leonard at that time hollywood was still a small_town and the motion_picture_industry in its infancy the social_life centered around the hollywood hotel and the cultural_life around the bookstore and small library across the street odo was the first to write book_reviews for the recently founded holly leaves a magazine printing motion_picture_news social_news and the life of the community as a whole
 was also the year odo first visited glendora which was back_country michigan avenue now glendora ave was the only oiled street in town at this time odo visited the ranger_station head_ranger sloan was planting trees at the time and odo planted a pine near the station the ranger_station still stands as a residence and the torrey pine odo planted was in recognized as the second largest torrey pine in california
by the motion_picture_industry was coming_into_its_own european talent displaced by the war and its aftermath saw hollywood as a mecca and writers actors and directors came in ever increasing numbers all of them discovering the hollywood bookstore sooner or later and odo the bookseller and linguist came_into_his_own he also had bit acting parts in numerous silent_films including blind husband miracle man world and its woman and the right to happiness with training from aerial_pioneer dick grace odo also became a movie stunt_pilot and wing_walker for jesse louis lasky defying death as he flew in wwi aerial_combat_scenes in germany and america
by french german italian and spanish books had to be added to the stock of books and it presently became necessary to move the store to larger quarters at the sale time mr leonard purchased the loftus art shop and combined it with the bookstore both stores grew rapidly with booming hollywood greater and greater demands_were_made upon odo and his staff and frequently odo was approached by the diverse studios to assist in research his establishment soon became known as one of the leading bookstores of the pacific coast and odo stade the resident expert he encouraged competition helped unity peque and jake zeitlin to start stores of their own by giving them stock and time he did in hollywood what mr vroman had done in pasadena
 odo hitherto a confirmed bachelor met maria engel who had come that year as assistant to howard greer the designer under contract to famous players lasky studios it was love at first sight
at hicksons in new york city maria engel worked in the field of fashion and became associated with howard greer a dress_designer together they did the greenwich village follies and they were engaged by famous players lasky studios in hollywood they went back to another greenwich village follies edition and returned to laskys it was during this time she first met ziegfeld dancers dorothy eleanor deuel which proved a valuable contact later in the s when odo and maria built their beautifully simple modern home in the back_lot of heinz and dorothy rubels property at leadora avenue
one evening early in maria went to the hollywood bookstore as she reached the door the proprietor was locking it up however to be accommodating he went back in to get the book she wanted she ordered some german books also odo went off to the mountains and three weeks later had the books delivered with a note asking if he might call
when she and odo were first married his uncle wanted him to return to hungary but maria felt within herself that she would never be accepted by the royal_family or the peasants
lasky gave odo the commission in to obtain_research in hollywood and its long island studios this trip took odo through most of the european countries and confirmed to him that his life was to be in the united states especially since his uncle strenuously objected to his marrying a commoner this break was never healed odo was cut off from his family and gladly returned to hollywood in october a few days after his return he married maria engel who left her lucrative position with the studio to assist him by taking_charge of the hollywood art shop where she achieved in a short while the same success as he did with the bookstore
 march frederick g leonard sold his interests in both stores to maria and odo stade and robert and emma holmes the latter the two silent_partners that year the store had to be enlarged once more and presently a rare_book_section was added by this time the hollywood bookstore had become known from coast to coast those were busy years for maria and odo the sales in both departments reached the half million mark by when in the booksellers convention was held in los angeles odo was chosen bookseller of the pacific coast

another professor of the same university jivatram kripalani introduced him to mohandas karamchand gandhi who held satish chandra so high that whenever gandhi went to varanasi he spent some time with satish chandra at a juncture it seems gandhi even approached him for receiving initiation but satish chandra did not feel that gandhi needed it both of them were seekers of god gandhi strove to solve the problem of suffering in mans daily_life and look for the truth satish chandra sought after spiritual_deliverance
following gandhis arrest in he spent two months at the sabarmati ashram helping in the management and publication of young india those were years when gandhi had been moving all over india without caring for his failing health one day satish chandra was asked by his guru bejoykrishna to send gandhi one hundred rupees every month for his personal use gratefully gandhi accepted this gift in hospitalized for appendicitis whereas gandhi was flooded with messages of solicitude he wondered about satish chandras silence and wanted his son devdas to enquire the only reply that came was that satish chandra knew that gandhi was going to recover soon
in the habit of exchanging letters regularly the last time satish chandra wrote to gandhi was on january explaining how to repeat the name of rama with a breath_control happy with that instruction on february gandhi thanked satish chandra for your lovely letter on january gandhi breathed his last by repeating he rama
satish chandra died on april 
satpula is a remarkable ancient water_harvesting_dam or weir located about east of the khirki masjid that is integral to the compound_wall of the medieval fourth city of the jahanpanah in delhi with its construction credited to the reign of sultan muhammad shah tughlaq muhammad bin tughluq of the tughlaq dynasty
the objective of building the weir was for providing water for irrigation and also as a part of the city_wall to provide defense_security to the city against attacking armies
satpula is a usage in urdu and hindi languages which literally means seven bridges
during the second decade rule of sultan muhammad shah tughlaq the economic_conditions of the delhi sultanate was in distress due to very high expenses incurred on the war_campaign in south india deccan and also due to the sultan establishing his southern capital at daulatabad both these acts necessitated increasing taxes to enhance the treasury_coffers to meet_large expenses but people were dissatisfied and distressed with these developments some tribal groups such as the chaghatai tribes had rebelled launched raids on many places in north india and even posed_serious_threats to delhi when the sultan was on his south indian campaign in the period between and repeated droughts had caused famines that were further compounded by the black plague these two natural_calamities had added to the suffering of the people in the country urgent solutions had to be found to remedy the distress_conditions one of the viable options planned was of building the satpula the seven arches bridge or gate_controlled weirdam to tap the water_resources of the local nallah stream feeding the yamuna river which could be used to bring large areas of flat land in the vicinity under controlled irrigated agriculture to grow food_crops to stem the famine_conditions this solution was also thought to provide the much needed defense to the walls of the newly built city of jahanpanah 
the location of the satpula which is a part of the eastwest wall protecting the southern part of jahanpanah drains a catchment comprising a series of low hills on the south east and west the stream draining the catchment_area known as barapulla nallah was planned to be tapped to store the runoff water of the catchment command_area for irrigation was identified in a large open plain on the northern side for providing water_supplies from the proposed storage behind the satpula to grow irrigated crops to sustain a large population 
thus a reliable water_storage_reservoir in the arid region of delhi which has the thar desert on its west was built as the headworks or weir across the barapulla nallah even though no epigraphic_evidence is available to date the satpula a reasseacrh_study_report has conjectured that it could be dated to the same time as the foureyyan mosque first of its kind in india called jami built by muhammad bin tughluq in 
the satpula across the stream was built as a gate_controlled weir the total length of the structure is it has been constructed in stone_masonry the eleven bays of the weir controlled by sluice_gates cover a total length of these eleven bays consist of eleven water_tunnels sluices each in length in height and in width these are located at different levels with seven main bays at the lowest level the balance two additional bays on each bank on the far east and west sides are at a higher level the control_arrangements seen now are in the form of gate grooves to operate vertical slide_gates when built wooden vertical sluice_gates made of heavy boards of size in thickness width and more than in height were operated by a rope and pulley arrangement to control flow of water the wooden gates have since disintegrated but the gate_groves are visible in each bay the gates of the sluices were closed as a defensive measure against possible attack in the dry_season when no storage remained in the dam each bay of the weir has an arched opening on both banks of the weir identical towers defensive bastions projecting on the south and north sides of diameter but with octagonal shape chambers are built which once functioned as madrasa islamic school of learning hence the satpula is also known as madarsa the second level sluice_bays on both banks lead to arched corridors the walls of the octagonal chambers have graceful decorations the stream tapped by this weir has been diverted now further east the indication of the use of the sluices of the structure either as a dam or for defense_purposes could be gauged from the platforms provided at the appropriate levels silt_deposition in the storage_area of the reservoir_side at the southern end is also seen now
the archaeological survey of india asi has recently carried out restoration_works of the satpula this restoration now permits access to the wide parapet of the bridge to fully view the impressive engineering_structure the restoration_works carried out by asi for specially identified monuments is in sync with the slogan welcome to historical city of delhi adopted by the commonwealth secretariat for the common wealth games to be held in delhi the restoration_works of the satpula is at an estimated cost of rs lakhs us for conservation of the monument to highlight its structural elegance by improving its overall view enhancing environmental aesthetics and its illumination
satpula is located about east of khirki masjid it is close to the present city_suburb of saket on the press enclave road in the medieval period it connected four principal cities namely the qila rai pithora the first city of delhi lal kot or qutub complex siri with the siri fort forming the second city of delhi tughlaqabad the third city of delhi and jahanpanah the fourth city of delhi the boundary_limits of which encompassed the other earlier built three cities it is locally believed that the waters stored by the weir had healing_powers because the sufi_saint nasirud din mahmud is reported to have used the waters of this reservoir for daily oblations before offering prayers at the mosque
the shadow riders known as the in the original japanese language version are a fictional group of villains in the yu gi oh gx anime_series appearing between episodes 
composed of seven duelists and their leader of varying origins and backgrounds who each have their own agendas the shadow riders serve as the main antagonists of the series first season intent on resurrecting the sacred beasts
however one of them returns in the fourth and final season as the true mastermind behind the mysterious attacks that take_place in duel academy and domino city

the shadow riders character designs were overseen by kenichi hara an example of one of these concepts can be seen in nightshroud who wears a tight fitting overcoat with raised shoulders and waistline and gold and green trimmings his dark dragon_mask similar to that worn by his signature_monster red eyes darkness dragon is completely black with the exception of blue eye pieces and a red stone in the center of the forehead in this incarnation the bangs closest to his face are positioned in front of the mask he carries and academy issued duel disk on his left hand
another example can be seen in amnael who wears a hooded tunic with a flowing red scarf boots and a mask with yellow eye pieces on his right hand is a glove made of heavier material and he carries a black model of the academy issued duel disk on his left despite the second japanese opening_sequence featuring his alter_ego with the standard disk given to all students and staff before his official debut as amnael in this incarnation he has white hair and the sides of his face are covered in pronounced veins and cracks
in the timeline of the yu gi oh gx anime enlisted by the elderly kagemaru in his quest to retrieve his lost youth the shadow riders are a collection of elite duelists who work towards the goal of reviving the sacred beast cards each of the members that jaden yuki and company_face possess a shadow charm similar to the millennium items in terms of supernatural_power but of unknown origin these relics bestow upon their owners different abilities depending on the shadow rider in question
in the past kagemaru was forced to seal the sacred beasts away behind the spirit gate underneath duel academy due to their inability to grant his wish at that time in order to access their true abilities he bestows upon chancellor sheppard the seven spirit keys capable of unlocking the gate and pits his subordinates against the schools finest to create the strong dueling presence needed to unleash the sacred beasts
 is the leader of the shadow riders and former superintendent of duel academy the kage portion of his name is derived from the japanese word kage meaning shadow in the english version kagemaru is voiced by david wills older and marc thompson younger while mugihito older and nobutoshi canna younger take_the_role in the japanese version
in horrible health kagemaru hoped to attain eternal_youth by sacrificing duel monster spirits to the sacred beasts during his duel with jaden his youth gradually returned after being defeated however he returned to his aged state he then asked_forgiveness and promised to renounce his former ways carried off to the hospital by helicopter he appears again as his younger self in episode 
kagemaru plays a sacred beast deck he carries a basic fiend deck to support raviel and plenty of spell and trap cards to support uria and hamon
nightshroud known as in the original japanese language version is the first shadow rider but in reality nightshroud is an entity of unknown origin tied to the darkness itself and the final antagonist in the series he entered the body of atticus rhodes and took_control nightshroud is voiced by hozumi gda in the japanese version while possessing atticus body nightshroud is voiced by jason anthony griffith in the english version while kouji yusa takes_the_role in the japanese version
being the owner of the other half of the shadow charm pendant in jadens possession nightshroud sets a shadow game for both of them where the loser has his soul sealed in a card when defeated nightshrouds soul represented by his mask is sealed away and atticus is freed
during the gx tournament atticus uses nightshrouds deck in hopes of convincing his friend zane truesdale that the dark path_taken by a duelist is a terrible course as a result nightshrouds influence that laid dormant within his cards is once again able to take_control of atticus only to be banished following his defeat
in the fourth season atticus again uses nightshrouds deck to duel jaden revealing he still has nightmares about his alter_ego during the duel atticus remembers that one of the missing students at the academy yusuke fujiwara was the original host of nightshroud and before he vanished he made atticus into a temporary host for nightshroud to inhabit but nightshroud eventually returns in the body of fujiwara and though he loses to atticus in a one on one duel he cheats reversing time and preventing atticus from playing red eyes burn but after losing to jaden when he and jesse double_teamed fujiwara nightshroud left his vessel and duels jaden in a match with the world at stake jaden reverses all of nightshrouds evil doings and finally destroys him though beaten nightshroud boasts that as long theres darkness in humans he would return but jaden counters by claiming that as long as there are bonds between humans nightshroud wont return in his final duel nightshroud is portrayed as megalomaniac or simply insane once he claims he is god and the savior
nightshroud while possessing atticus plays a red eyes darkness dragon deck which focuses on quickly summoning the eponymous card and strengthening it by placing a large number of dragon type monsters in his graveyard once within the body of fujiwara nightshroud uses a clear deck which shuts down the opponents strategies based on the attributes of the monsters they summon once without a host nightshroud uses his personal darkness deck which controls the field through its darkness field_spell_card
 is the second shadow rider her name is derived from the title of joseph sheridan le fanus novel carmilla in the english version camula is voiced by bella hudson while kanako irie takes_the_role in the japanese version
a vampire camula is very serious when it comes to dueling as she hopes to revive her race from its destruction by the people of medieval times she had been asleep within her coffin until kagemaru uncovered it and invited her to join the shadow riders she captures the souls of her opponents following their losses within dolls to fuel her cause and uses the shadow charm strangler around her neck to bet the souls of others in conjunction with the shadow game exclusive illusion gate to ensure victory she manages to obtain the keys of crowler and zane but during her duel with jaden her shadow charms power is negated by the completed item that jaden possesses out of self confidence camula places her own soul on the line and it is dragged into the gate after she loses leaving her body empty and turning it to dust
camula plays a vampire deck several of her monsters such as zombie werewolf and vampire bat can feint revival by either summoning or discarding additional copies of themselves when destroyed through battle camula is also able to combine the recursion ability of vampire genesis with genesis crisis to repetitively raise her undead army from the grave
 is the third shadow rider in the english version tania is voiced by alyson johnson while kazue komiya takes_the_role in the japanese version
a white_tiger that assumes human_form with her shadow charm gauntlet to find a worthy duelist to be her husband tania travels with another tiger named bass who resembles the amazoness tiger she falls_in love with bastion misawa and after some sweet_talking and showing off her amazing dueling skills defeats him and makes him her bridegroom for a short time until she grows tired of him tania then fights jaden in a soul_match with the effect of amazon arena and eventually resumes her true form and runs off she appears before jaden and his group during the third year as her human self having been sucked into the second alternate dimension they visit since their last meeting she serves as their guide through the first town they encounter and stays behind with bastion after jaden liberates it
tanias amazoness cards based on the amazons of greek mythology are divided into two decks courage and knowledge the former focusing on offense with more damage inflicted via amazoness arena while the latter is more based on turning the opponents battle_strategies against them she uses the knowledge deck against bastion and the courage deck against jaden
 is the fourth shadow rider in the english version zaloog is voiced by darren dunstan who impersonates christopher walken while taiten kusunoki takes_the_role in the japanese version
zaloog is actually a duel monster spirit brought_to_life by the power of the shadow charm eyepatch he wears he is also the leader of the band of thieves known as the dark scorpion gang in the original japanese language version who were also brought_to_life by the item he masquerades as a detective named detective zaloog police_inspector manguer sent to assist the students in hiding the remaining spirit keys while his posse work on taking_the keys incognito however since they fail to obtain the keys in a duel they are unable to unlock the spirit gate of the sacred beasts when zaloog and his gang are discovered he and chazz princeton duel with all the remaining keys on the line in the end he and his cohorts are defeated and the power of his shadow charm is nullified after reverting back to their spirit_forms the dark scorpions join the many weak monsters in chazzs care to the young duelists annoyance 
zaloog plays a dark scorpion deck themed on bringing together the members of the dark scorpion gang and triggering their five effects in unison with support from cards such as mustering of the dark scorpions and dark scorpion combination like his card however in the english anime he wields twin_swords and in the japanese version he wields guns
 is the fifth shadow rider his name is derived from the name of the ancient egyptian city abydos in the english version abidos is voiced by darren dunstan while mamoru miyano takes_the_role in the japanese version
an ancient pharaoh who never lost a single duel abidos regained physical_form through the powers of the shadow charm headband he wears with an army of mummies abidos gathers jaden and company on his celestial yacht for a duel during the duel with jaden abidos realizes that the only reason he kept winning was because his opponents always lost on purpose simply because he was pharaoh jaden however manages to give abidos a real duel in which the opponent actually tries to win satisfied with his defeat abidos departs for the afterlife giving jaden his shadow charm the latter making_a_promise to meet him again in one hundred years time presuming that jaden will be dead within that time 
abidos plays a servants of the pharaoh deck themed on gathering three sarcophagus cards to summon spirit of the pharaoh
 is the sixth shadow rider in the english version titan is voiced by eric stuart while norio wakamoto takes_the_role in the japanese version
a hitman originally hired by crowler to deal with jaden titan captured alexis rhodes to force jaden into a duel for her life despite his reputation of possessing the power of a millennium item the millennium item turned out to be a fake millennium puzzle and titan used various tricks to mimic a shadow game he became the victim of a real shadow duel however but was saved by kagemaru wearing a shadow charm mask to bind him to the real world taking_advantage of alexis desire to restore her brothers memories titan challenges her in the abandoned dorm where they first met he is ultimately pulled back into the pits of darkness when he is defeated
titan plays an archfiend demon deck composed largely of monsters based on chess_pieces in his first encounter with jaden which is later supported by fiend bullfighter demons matador cards in his duel with alexis this last deck is inspired by spanish traditions with names related to bullfighting such as picador matador and banderillero

solid_phase_extraction spe is a separation_process by which compounds that are dissolved or suspended in a liquid_mixture are separated from other compounds in the mixture according to their physical and chemical_properties analytical_laboratories use solid_phase_extraction to concentrate and purify samples for analysis solid_phase_extraction can be used to isolate analytes of interest from a wide variety of matrices including urine blood water beverages soil and animal_tissue
spe uses the affinity of solutes dissolved or suspended in a liquid known as the mobile_phase for a solid through which the sample is passed known as the stationary_phase to separate a mixture into desired and undesired components the result is that either the desired analytes of interest or undesired impurities in the sample are retained on the stationary_phase the portion that passes through the stationary_phase is collected or discarded depending on whether it contains the desired analytes or undesired impurities if the portion retained on the stationary_phase includes the desired analytes they can then be removed from the stationary_phase for collection in an additional step in which the stationary_phase is rinsed with an appropriate eluent
the stationary_phase comes in the form of a packed syringe shaped cartridge a_well_plate or a or mm flat disk each of which can be mounted on its specific type of extraction_manifold the manifold allows multiple samples to be processed by holding several spe_media in place and allowing for an equal number of samples to pass through them simultaneously a typical cartridge_spe_manifold can accommodate up to cartridges while a typical disk_spe_manifold can accommodate disks most spe_manifolds are equipped with a vacuum_port application of vacuum speeds up the extraction_process by pulling the liquid_sample through the stationary_phase the analytes are collected in sample_tubes inside or below the manifold after they pass through the stationary_phase
solid_phase_extraction cartridges and disks are available with a variety of stationary_phases each of which can separate analytes according to different chemical_properties most stationary_phases are based on silica that has been bonded to a specific functional_group some of these functional_groups include hydrocarbon_chains of variable length for reversed_phase_spe quaternary_ammonium or amino_groups for anion_exchange and sulfonic_acid or carboxyl_groups for cation_exchange
a typical solid_phase_extraction involves four basic steps first the cartridge is equilibrated with a non polar solvent or slightly polar which wets the surface and penetrates the bonded phase then water or buffer of the same composition as the sample is typically washed through the column to wet the silica_surface the sample is then added to the cartridge as the sample passes through the stationary_phase the analytes in the sample will interact and retain on the sorbent while the solvent salts and other impurities pass through the cartridge after the sample is loaded the cartridge is washed with buffer or solvent to remove further impurities then the analyte is eluted with a non polar solvent or a buffer of the appropriate ph 
a stationary_phase of polar functionally bonded silicas with short carbons_chains frequently makes up the solid_phase this stationary_phase will adsorb polar molecules which can be collected with a more polar solvent
reversed_phase_spe separates analytes based on their polarity the stationary_phase of a reversed_phase_spe cartridge is derivatized with hydrocarbon_chains which retain compounds of mid to low polarity due to the hydrophobic_effect the analyte can be eluted by washing the cartridge with a non polar solvent which disrupts the interaction of the analyte and the stationary_phase
a stationary_phase of silicon with carbon_chains is commonly used relying on mainly non polar hydrophobic interactions only non polar or very weakly polar compounds will adsorb to the surface
ion_exchange_sorbents separate analytes based on electrostatic_interactions between the analyte of interest and the positively_charged groups on the stationary_phase for ion_exchange to occur both the stationary_phase and sample must be at a ph where both are charged
anion_exchange sorbents are derivatized with positively_charged functional_groups that interact and retain negatively_charged anions such as acids strong anion_exchange sorbents contain quaternary_ammonium groups that have a permanent positive_charge in aqueous_solutions and weak anion_exchange sorbents use amine_groups which are charged when the ph is below about strong anion_exchange sorbents are useful because any strongly acidic impurities in the sample will bind to the sorbent and usually will not be eluted with the analyte of interest to recover a strong acid a weak anion_exchange cartridge should be used to elute the analyte from either the strong or weak sorbent the stationary_phase is washed with a solvent that neutralizes the charge of either the analyte the stationary_phase or both once the charge is neutralized the electrostatic_interaction between the analyte and the stationary_phase no longer exists and the analyte will elute from the cartridge
cation_exchange sorbents are derivatized with functional_groups that interact and retain positively_charged cations such as bases strong cation_exchange sorbents contain aliphatic sulfonic_acid groups that are always negatively_charged in aqueous_solution and weak cation_exchange sorbents contain aliphatic_carboxylic_acids which are charged when the ph is above about strong cation_exchange sorbents are useful because any strongly basic impurities in the sample will bind to the sorbent and usually will not be eluted with the analyte of interest to recover a strong base a weak cation_exchange cartridge should be used to elute the analyte from either the strong or weak sorbent the stationary_phase is washed with a solvent that neutralizes ionic_interaction between the analyte and the stationary_phase
south dunedin is a major inner city_suburb of the new zealand city of dunedin it is located as its name suggests to the south of the city_centre on a large plain known locally simply as the flat the suburb is a mix of industrial retail and predominantly lower quality residential_properties south dunedins population was 
south dunedin is a wide area of flat land much of it reclaimed from the otago harbour this reclaimed area which lies immediately to the west of the harbours head is known as the southern endowment and covers an area of close to 
the southern endowment was begun with rock removed during the cutting of bell hill in the central_city during the nineteenth century this largely extended the area around the wharves close to the heart of the city but did not extend any further south until when a causeway was built along the head of the harbour as part of a otago harbour board scheme to reclaim land for industrial_use dredges started to pump tailings into the area behind the causeway in the s reclamation continued for many years and was not officially completed until the opening of portsmouth drive which runs along the route of the causeway at the harbour_edge in 
most of the area of the southern endowment is industrial and storage though it does contain a small part close to the wharf_area and the major sports_complex of the edgar centre close to its southern edge
south dunedin contains the citys second most important retail_district centred on cargills corner named for otago provincial founder captain william cargill hillside road at one time called cargill road is named for his house hillside which lay some to the north at this junction two main suburban arterial_routes king edward street and hillside road cross a small shopping mall south city is located at cargills corner
cargills corner had for many years dunedins only barnes_dance pedestrian_crossing its use was phased out during the s
king edward street is aligned roughly north south linking with the southern end of princes street and the centre_city in the north with the densely_populated coastal suburb of saint kilda hillside road links andersons bay road a further major suburban arterial in the east with the suburbs of caversham corstorphine and saint clair in the west and southwest
smaller older shops stretch south along king edward street and west along hillside road from cargills corner to the east along hillside road and andersons bay road are larger supermarkets and wholesalers notably pakn save the warehouse and mitre mega further along andersons bay road to the south and to the west on hillside road are numerous car_sale_yards and light_industrial works these extend into caversham in the west and across the reclaimed land which lies between andersons bay road and portsmouth drive in the south and east at its southern extreme king edward street becomes increasingly residential though there are also light_industrial premises here
andersons bay road lies roughly parallel with king edward street some to the east this route which roughly follows the original shoreline connects with state highway and dunedins one way street system in the north and with the suburb of musselburgh in the south it also provides a major route from the centre_city with otago peninsula 
portsmouth drive a further arterial_route lies a further to the east this route links the centre_city with portobello road the long twisting route which travels the length of otago peninsulas harbour_coast it is named for dunedins american sister_city of portsmouth virginia
other important roads in south dunedin include timaru street on the southern endowment and several streets which cross or meet king edward street linking it with andersons bay road in the east or the suburbs of saint clair and forbury in the west these include macandrew road melbourne street mcbride street and bay view road the latter of which forms_the_boundary between south dunedin and saint kilda
the industrial heart of south dunedin is the hillside railway workshops located immediately to the west of cargills corner these workshops cover some and stretch into the neighbouring suburb of caversham other notable buildings in south dunedin include the mayfair theatre close to cargills corner and the edgar sports centre at the southeastern extremity of the suburb on portsmouth drive the citys main sports_complex carisbrook is located close to the border of south dunedin in caversham a former stadium the caledonian ground stood on ground now largely occupied by the warehouse retail_store it was relocated in to logan park in dunedin north the junction of andersons bay road and hillside road located nearby is still sometimes referred to as caledonian corner
this corner is also the former site of the countrys longest serving gasworks which operated from to and a small industrial museum the dunedin gasworks museum is located on the southern part of its site on braemar street opened to the public in this museum is one of only three known preserved gasworks_museums in the world the museum features five steam_pumping_engines which were used in the gasworks and an older engine imported from scotland in 
there are several notable churches in south dunedin among them the citys only eastern orthodox church st michaels in fingall street and st patricks roman_catholic basilica designed by francis petre in macandrew road
other than the hillside workshops and the gasworks south dunedin has several links with dunedins industrial heritage notable among these was the factory of g methven one of new zealands leading bathroom_fittings_manufacturers this company founded by george methven was located for many years in andersons bay road on a site now occupied by a mitre megastore
another former landmark in south dunedin was the former caledonian sports_ground this was located opposite the gasworks at the corner of hillside road and andersons bay road a site still known as the caledonian corner the sports_field was relocated to dunedin north and the site is now the car_park of the warehouse all that remains of the original sports_complex is a lawn_bowls_club and the gymnasium which is also south dunedins main war_memorial hillside workshops have their own separate memorial by the sites main gate
 the northeastern edge of the suburb closest to the city_centre is the smaller suburb of kensington kensington is located on and around king edward street at the foot of a spur of maryhill officially referred to as montecillo ridge and close to the inner city sports_ground the oval this ground originally called the southern recreation ground is often referred to as the kensington oval so as to distinguish it from the university oval in the north of the city this ground is actually triangular but at one time contained a separate oval cricket_ground which gave it its name dunedin southern cemetery sits on the slope of montecillo ridge immediately above kensington separated from it by south road a main route to caversham which joins with princes street close to the oval these two green areas mark the southernmost extreme of dunedins town belt which sweeps around the central_city in a broad crescent through the suburbs of mornington belleknowes roslyn maori hill woodhaugh and dunedin north 
the lower slopes of montecillo ridge were at one time the site of hillside the home of dunedin citys founding_father captain william cargill though the house is long gone its name lives on in that of south dunedins hillside road
kensington is largely separated from south dunedin by an overbridge carrying the south island main trunk railway the long closed kensington railway_halt was located immediately to the east of the bridge and accessed by a flight of stairs in one of the bridges supports long since sealed up a newer flyover metres to the north carries state highway through kensington though there are no slip_roads connecting the suburb with the highway this flyover separates kensington into two distinct parts a light_industrial zone to the south of the flyover and a residential_zone to the north at the foot of the ridge
a notable feature of kensington is the citys army_drill_hall located in bridgman street immediately to the south of state highway 
in telecommunications squelch is a circuit_function that acts to suppress the audio or video_output of a receiver in the absence of a sufficiently strong desired input_signal 
squelch excludes undesired lower power input_signals that may be present at or near the frequency of the desired signal squelch is a noise_gate that only allows signals at a specified strength over a threshold to be played through the speaker as an example general_static with no transmission is squelched out contrast with noise_suppression
a carrier_squelch or noise_squelch is the most simple variant of all it operates strictly on the signal_strength such as when a television mutes the audio or blanks the video on empty channels or when a walkie_talkie mutes the audio when no signal is present in some designs the squelch_threshold is preset for example television_squelch_settings are usually preset receivers in base_stations at remote mountain top_sites are usually not adjustable remotely from the control_point
in devices such as radiotelephones also known as two way radios the squelch can be adjusted with a knob others have push_buttons or a sequence of button_presses this setting adjusts the threshold at which signals will open un mute the audio_channel backing off the control will turn on the audio and the operator will hear white_noise also_called squelch_noise if there is no signal present the usual operation is to adjust the control until the channel just shuts off then only a small threshold_signal is needed to turn on the speaker however if a weak signal is annoying the operator can adjust the squelch to open only when stronger signals are received if you hold_the squelch open you will also get a lot of noise
a typical fm two way radio carrier_squelch circuit takes out the voice_components of the receive_audio by passing the detected audio through a high pass filter a typical filter might pass frequencies over hz khz the squelch_control adjusts the gain of an amplifier which varies the level of noise coming out of the filter the audio_output of the filter and amplifier is rectified and produces a dc_voltage when noise is present the presence of noise creates a dc_voltage which turns the receiver_audio off when a signal with little or no noise is received the voltage goes away and the receiver_audio is unmuted some applications have the receiver tied to other equipment that uses the audio_muting_control_voltage as a signal present indication
tone_squelch or other forms of selective_calling are sometimes used to solve interference_problems where more than one user is on the same channel co channel users selective_calling addresses a subset of all receivers instead of turning on the receive_audio for any signal the audio turns on only in the presence of the correct selective_calling code this is akin to the use of a lock on a door a carrier_squelch is unlocked and will let any signal in selective_calling locks out all signals except ones with the correct code 
in non critical uses selective_calling can also be used to hide the presence of interfering_signals such as receiver produced intermodulation receivers with poor specifications such as scanners or low cost mobile_radios cannot reject the strong signals present in urban_environments the interference will still be present it will still degrade system_performance but by using selective_calling the user will not have to hear the noises produced by receiving the interference 
four different techniques are commonly used selective_calling can be regarded as a form of in band signaling
ctcss continuous tone coded squelch_system continuously superimposes any one of about low pitch audio tones on the transmitted signal ranging from to hz the original tone_set was tones and has been expanded over the years ctcss is often called pl tone for private line a trademark of motorola or simply tone_squelch general electrics implementation of ctcss is called channel guard or cg rca corporation used the name quiet channel or qc there are many other company specific names used by radio_vendors to describe compatible options any ctcss system that has compatible tones is interchangeable old and new radios with ctcss and radios across manufacturers are compatible
selcall selective_calling transmits a burst of five inband_audio_tones at the beginning of each transmission this feature sometimes called tone_burst is common in european systems in the same way that a single ctcss tone would be used on an entire group of radios a single five tone sequence is used in a group of radios
dcs digital coded squelch superimposes a continuous stream of fsk digital data at bits per second on the transmitted signal in the same way that a single ctcss tone would be used on an entire group of radios the same dcs code is used in a group of radios dcs is also referred to as digital private line or dpl another trademark of motorola and likewise general electrics implementation of dcs is referred to a digital channel guard or dcg dcs is also_called dtcs digital tone code squelch by icom and other names by other manufacturers radios with dcs options are generally compatible provided the radios encoder decoder will use the same code as radios in the existing system
be aware that the same bit dcs word can for example produce three different valid dcs codes
xtcss is the newest signaling_technique and it provides codes with the added advantage of silent_operation xtcss fitted radios are purposed to enjoy more privacy and flexibility of operation xtcss is implemented as a combination of ctcss and in band signalling
carrier_squelch was invented first and is still in wide use in two way radio especially in the amateur_radio_world squelch of any kind is used to indicate loss of signal which is used to keep commercial and amateur_radio_repeaters from transmitting continually since a carrier_squelch receiver cannot tell a valid carrier from a spurious signal noise etc ctcss is often used as well as it avoids false keyups use of ctcss is especially helpful on bands prone to skip and during band_openings
family radio service frs and pmr radios often use a number of different ctcss tones usually erroneously called sub channels the actual number of tones depends on the manufacturer while these do not add to the available number of conversations which can take_place at once in a given area they do reduce annoying interference experienced by users however they do not afford any protection from eavesdropping as the voice_signal is not encrypted the squelch_system relies on the receiver to comply with the squelch_signal but if a receiver chooses to listen in the signal is not protected
it is a bad idea to use any coded squelch_system to hide interference_issues in systems with life safety or public safety uses such as police fire search and rescue or ambulance_company_dispatching adding tone or digital squelch to a radio_system doesnt solve interference_issues it just covers them up the presence of interfering_signals should be corrected rather than masked interfering_signals masked by tone_squelch will produce apparently random missed messages the intermittent nature of interfering_signals will make the problem difficult to reproduce and troubleshoot users will not understand why they cannot hear a call and will lose confidence in their radio_system
professional wireless microphones use squelch to avoid reproducing noise when the receiver does not receive enough signal from the microphone most professional models have adjustable squelch usually set with a screwdriver_adjustment on the receiver

summer shaw is a fictional character from the long running channel soap_opera hollyoaks played by summer strallen the character is most notable for being planted in the show as publicity for an andrew lloyd webber produced stage_production of the sound of music making_national_headlines summer the fictional character won the same leading_role of maria that strallen had been cast as in the west end show
summer arrives as an undergraduate at hollyoaks community college who has moved to chester and who seems to have_an interfering mother constantly phoning her to check if she is okay john paul and katy spot her conversing with her mother on the phone and realise a pair of underwear has dropped from her suitcase as she gathers her bags and walks off to find the admissions office john paul screams for her but she does not hear him later while dining at il gnosh the two spot her again where john paul timidly returns the pair of underwear to her and introduces himself the two strike up a friendship and while walking through the college she talks lots about herself and her passion for the performing_arts john paul invites her for a drink which katy does not join them probably as she finds her a bit full_on while john paul strikes up a conversation with jay summer befriends russ while sitting at the bar
while attending john pauls housewarming_party at the halls summer caught_the_eye of kris fisher the carbon_monoxide_leak from the faulty boiler rendered her unconscious along with all the other people in the party summer was drowsy but recovered at the scene she was given the all clear by doctors and was told to go home
at a swimming_pool in which ob had taken tom to teach him how to swim ob saw summer and started chatting her up he was so busy talking to her that he didnt notice tom taking his armbands off before jumping in and having to be saved by simon crosby summer then started working at mobs where it was obvious that ob had_a_crush on her and she clashed with max cunninghams girlfriend steph dean who she worked with and originally met after they both went for a part to star in a health_and_safety_video
after running into nancy hayton and sarah barnes the trio decided to go for a drink when a guy walked into the su bar when sarah said oohid have a bit of thatwhere nancy replied nohes not my type before summer noticed him and called out james nancy and sarah both looked horrified by what they said
james summers long term boyfriend is in the army and tells summer hes on leave because he is to spend five months in afghanistan and he leaves the next day summer considered asking him to staybefore a heart to heart with sarah who asked her what if you landed a part in a broadway show id ask him to come with me for him to drop everything to follow your dreams when you wouldnt let him follow his summer understood that she couldnt have it all her way and let him go after telling him if you get yourself killed out there ill murder you you say that everytime the pair kiss and james left in a taxi
on the th november summer received a phone_call from james after the credits had ended she was crying and told ob that it was over between her and james she ran off leaving ob alone at the dog in the pond
summer recently shared_a_kiss with kris fisher after their radio_show was taken over by pirates aka john paul mcqueen and elliot bevan but then it was revealed that they are a couple when she tells ob i never would have thought i would have a boyfriend who looked better than me in lipgloss
however after realising her feelings for ob she breaks up with kris claiming he is too high maintenance this results in quite a nasty argument between them kris calling summer shallow while summer stated that cross dressing didnt make him any more special and that he wakes up in the morning and thinks who shall i be today male or female
later kris sees summer having_lunch with ob and is angrybut when ob defends her kris and ob fight ending in summer pouring water over them
on january after steph suggested that they should form a band summer decided shed had enough of life in hollyoaks and wanted to try her luck at living in london she wanted to be able to chase her dreams and not wait for the opportunities to come to her she asked ob to go with her but he refused saying that he couldnt let max down by leaving after one last ditch_attempt to convince ob to come with her she walked out the door
later max convinced ob to leave with summer saying that she is the best thing thats ever happened to him they race to the bus_station in the mobs van arriving just as the bus is about to leave ob hopped on the bus and tells summer that she only asked him twice to leave and everyone knows that its three times for luck after a hug and a kiss they departed for london with max looking on
after arriving in london summer sets about trying to find andrew lloyd webber so that she can try to get a part in one of his plays
on february despite her nerves during an audition summer has successfully been offered a part of maria in the sound of music one of andrew lloyd webbers plays
on february summer made_her_exit from hollyoaks leading a new life to star in one of andrew lloyd webbers plays but with obs second_thoughts about moving out summer realises she has to start a new life alone even without him
on february ob chased his dream and him and summer got back together with him remaining in london with her to start their new life the last time her being seen onscreen

the tabuk sniper_rifle is an iraqi modification of a serbian designated marksmans rifle made from as a modified version of the zastava m assault_rifle the tabuk sniper_rifle like all the ak and dragunov svd derivatives made in iraq was manufactured at the al qadissiya establishments using machineries sold to iraq with the power at the time still firmly in the hands of saddam hussein by zastava of yugoslavia
zastava of yugoslavia originally developed this rifle from its experience in making its m rifles a variant of the akm with some minor differences from the original particularly the m all of the rifles in the m series share what is traditionally considered an rpk style receiver that is the receiver is made with a thicker gauge of sheet_metal formed over a larger and heavier trunion while this does add to weight it has a positive effect on durability which is why the modification came about for the russian rpk the yugoslavian rpk or m is the longer barreled member of the m family and is the weapons upon which the tabuk is based 
the tabuk rifle unlike the yugoslavian rpk has a barrel including flash_hider the actual barrel_length is closer to slightly shorter than a soviet rpk but much longer than a traditional akm or the m the tabuk like the rpk has a provision for muzzle_attachments in the typical russian thread_pattern of xmm left_hand_thread which means that it can accept several variations of soviet flash_hiders and muzzle_brakes as well as soviet designed sound_suppression_devices 
after incidents in baghdad in the summer of initial media_descriptions of the tabuk rifle were misspelled in many media_reports as tobuk or tobok tabooktabouk the latter two spellings are more correct transliterations of the arabic is a common place_name in the arab world as it was the site of an historically significant battle during the lifetime of the muslim prophet mohammed the most common association is probably the capitol_city of the saudi province of the same name saudi arabia maps county_detail provinces

in many of these reports the tabuk rifle is described incorrectly as being based on the svd dragunov unlike the kalashnikov ak and ak rifles which fire xmm and xmm rounds respectively the dragunov and its variants chamber the older xmmr cartridge adopted by the russian army in by way of the mosin nagant rifle that in various forms was used through the end of world war ii and beyond
this would be an easy mistake_to_make as the furniture of the tabuk looks much like the dragunov and has a longer barrel like that of the latter rifles mm inches
the differences between the tabuk and the yugo rpk are in fact few the semi_auto only internals included with the tabuk is a visually unobvious difference but perhaps the most important it is this feature that dictates the rifles role as one of precision_fire and not suppressive_fire it is also important as it prevents relatively untrained individuals from subjecting the barrel of a rifle intended for precision to ful alto fire as such would only act to shorten said rifles useful life 
a more distinguishing difference and perhaps the most important visual cue is the fact that the rpks barrel is finned at the rear near the hand_guards and far heavier than a standard akm or for that matter the tabuk the weight thickness of the rpks barrel exists to facilitate heat_distribution via mass and cooling via surface_area since the option to fire full auto has been omitted and it is not typical of eastern_block_long_range_precision_rifles to use heavy barrels for accuracy the tabuk like the svd and the psl has a relatively light barrel 
the tabuk differs from the m in some other ways it has the provision for mounting optics for one though this is not an unusual accessory on eastern_bloc weapons and it has a skeletonized buttstock with a cheek_piece a third difference and perhaps the most important though not definitive visual cue when identifying the tabuk is the conspicuous lack of a bipod the bipod which is not detachable from the m though sometimes removed by undisciplined troops is quite obvious from afar when attached it was likely removed to enhance mechanical_accuracy and reduce weight though if it were left attached it may have added stability practical_accuracy for long_range_work 
as it is essentially an accurized scoped rpk the tabuk is subsequently chambered in the rpks primary caliber x this is advantageous as it allows the tabuk to use the same magazines as the ak and ak magazines are well_made plentiful and easy to replace if lost
because the tabuk it is chambered in the soviet m or xmm cartridge it cannot technically function as a sniper_rifle by western standards with a maximum effective_range of only m based on trajectory the tabuk should instead be considered a designated marksmans rifle that said and considering the terrain upon which these rifles are typically fielded urban this quibble is purely semantics 
the tabuk is within its given range every bit as effective as the dragunov or psl if used precisely however from the point of terminal_ballistics the soviet xmm is too stable in tissue at the far end of its effective_range it is decidedly less lethal than its higher_velocity_counterparts due to the rounds combination of stability and low velocity giving it less reach than the xr caliber svd it visually resembles an rpk which may make identifying enemy snipersdesignated marks men more difficult likewise its acoustic signature mimics that of an ak being chambered for a relatively low_velocity_intermediate_round the tabuk has poor barrier_penetration and performance against body_armor compared to weapons chambered for full powered cartridges like x or xr

 was a daimyo in the sengoku period who unified the political_factions of japan he succeeded his former liege_lord oda nobunaga and brought_an_end to the sengoku period the period of his rule is often called the momoyama period named after hideyoshis castle he is noted for a number of cultural legacies including the restriction that only members of the samurai_class could bear_arms hideyoshi is regarded as japans second great unifier
very little is known for certain about hideyoshi before when he begins to appear in surviving documents and letters his autobiography starts in but in it hideyoshi spoke very little about his past by tradition he was born in what is now nakamura ku nagoya situated in modern day aichi district owari province the home of the oda clan he was born of no traceable samurai_lineage being the son of a peasant warrior named yaemon
 he had no surname and his childhood_given_name was bounty of the sun although variations exist 
toyotomi hideyoshi had been given the nickname kozaru meaning little monkey from his lord oda nobunaga because his facial features and skinny form resembled that of a monkey he was also known as the bald rat
many legends describe hideyoshi being sent to study at a temple as a young man but he rejected temple_life and went in search of adventure under the name he first joined the imagawa clan as a servant to a local ruler named matsushita yukitsuna he traveled all the way to the lands of imagawa yoshimoto daimyo of suruga province and served there for a time only to abscond with a sum of money entrusted to him by matsushita yukitsuna
around he returned to owari province and joined the oda clan now headed by oda nobunaga as a lowly servant he became one of nobunagas sandal bearers and was present at the battle of okehazama in when nobunaga defeated imagawa yoshimoto to become one of the most powerful warlords in the sengoku period according to his biographers he supervised the repair of kiyosu castle a claim described as apocryphal and managed the kitchen in hideyoshi married nene who was asano nagamasas adopted daughter he carried out repairs on sunomata castle with his younger brother toyotomi hidenaga and the bandits hachisuka masakatsu and maeno nagayasu hideyoshis efforts were well_received because sunomata was in enemy_territory he constructed a fort in sunomata according to legend overnight and discovered a secret_route into mount inaba after which much of the garrison surrendered
hideyoshi was very successful as a negotiator in he managed to convince mostly with liberal bribes a number of mino warlords to desert the saito clan hideyoshi approached many saito clan samurai and convinced them to submit to nobunaga including the saito clans strategist takenaka hanbei 
nobunagas easy victory at inabayama castle in was largely due to hideyoshis efforts and despite his peasant_origins hideyoshi became one of nobunagas most distinguished generals eventually taking_the name hashiba hideyoshi the new surname included two characters one each from odas two other right hand men niwa nagahide and shibata katsuie 
hideyoshi led troops in the battle of anegawa in in which oda nobunaga allied with future rival tokugawa ieyasu who would eventually displace hideyoshis son and rule japan to lay_siege to two fortresses of the azai and asakura clans in after victorious campaigns against the azai and asakura nobunaga appointed hideyoshi daimyo of three districts in the northern part of omi province initially based at the former azai headquarters in odani hideyoshi moved to kunitomo and renamed the city nagahama in tribute to nobunaga hideyoshi later moved to the port at imahama on lake biwa from there he began work on imahama castle and took_control of the nearby kunitomo firearms_factory that had been established some years previously by the azai and asakura under hideyoshis administration the factorys output of firearms increased dramatically nobunaga sent hideyoshi to himeji castle to conquer chugoku region in 
after the assassinations at honno ji of oda nobunaga and his eldest son nobutada in at the hands of akechi mitsuhide hideyoshi defeated akechi at the battle of yamazaki
at a meeting at kiyosu to decide on a successor to nobunaga hideyoshi cast aside the apparent candidate oda nobutaka and his advocate oda clans chief_general shibata katsuie by supporting nobutadas young son oda hidenobu having won the support of the other two oda elders niwa nagahide and ikeda tsuneoki hideyoshi established hidenobus position as well as his own influence in the oda clan tension quickly escalated between hideyoshi and katsuie and at the battle of shizugatake in the following year hideyoshi destroyed katsuies forces and thus consolidated his own power absorbing most of the oda clan into his control
in hideyoshi began construction of osaka castle built on the site of the temple ishiyama honganji destroyed by nobunaga the castle would become the last stronghold of the toyotomi clan after hideyoshis death
nobunagas other son oda nobukatsu remained hostile to hideyoshi he allied himself with tokugawa ieyasu and the two sides fought at the inconclusive battle of komaki and nagakute it ultimately resulted in a stalemate although hideyoshis forces were delivered a heavy blow finally hideyoshi made_peace with nobukatsu ending the pretext for war between the tokugawa and hashiba clans hideyoshi sent tokugawa ieyasu his younger sister asahi no kata and mother omandokoro as hostages ieyasu eventually agreed to become a vassal of hideyoshi
like nobunaga before him hideyoshi never achieved the title of shogun instead he arranged to have himself adopted into the fujiwara regents house and secured a succession of high_imperial_court_titles including in the prestigious position of regent kampaku in hideyoshi was formally given the name toyotomi by the imperial_court he built a lavish palace the jurakudai in and entertained the reigning emperor go yozei the following year
afterwards hideyoshi subjugated kii province and conquered shikoku under the chosokabe clan he also took_control of etchu province and conquered kyushu in hideyoshi banished christian missionaries from kyushu to exert greater control over the kirishitan daimyo however since he made_much_of_trade with europeans individual christians were overlooked unofficially in hideyoshi forbade ordinary peasants from owning weapons and started a sword_hunt to confiscate arms the swords were melted down to create a statue of the buddha this measure effectively stopped peasant_revolts and ensured greater stability at the expense of freedom of the individual daimyo the siege of odawara against the late hojo clan in kanto eliminated the last resistance to hideyoshis authority his victory signified the end of the sengoku period during this siege hideyoshi proposed that ieyasu currently controlled five provinces were submitted and ieyasu receive the eight kanto provinces that kitajo ruled ieyasu accepted this proposal and date masamune pledged loyalty to the hideyoshi
in february hideyoshi ordered sen no rikyu to commit_suicide rikyu had been a trusted retainer and master of the tea_ceremony under both hideyoshi and nobunaga under hideyoshis patronage rikyu made_significant_changes to the aesthetics of the tea_ceremony that had lasting influence over many aspects of japanese culture even after he ordered rikyus suicide hideyoshi is said to have built his many construction_projects based upon principles of beauty promoted by rikyu
following rikyus death hideyoshi turned his attentions from tea_ceremony to noh which he had been studying in the komparu style since becoming kampaku during his brief stay in nagoya castle in what is today saga prefecture on kyushu hideyoshi memorized the shite lead_roles parts of ten noh plays which he then performed forcing various daimyo to accompany him onstage as the waki secondary accompanying role he even performed before the emperor
the stability of the toyotomi dynasty after hideyoshis death was put_in_doubt with the death of his only_son tsurumatsu in september the three year old was his only_child when his half brother hidenaga died shortly after his son hideyoshi named his nephew hidetsugu his heir adopting him in january hideyoshi resigned as kampaku to take the title of taiko retired regent hidetsugu succeeded him as kampaku
his health beginning to falter but still yearning for some accomplishment to solidify his legacy hideyoshi adopted the dream of a japanese conquest of china that oda nobunaga had contemplated and launched two ill fated invasions of korea though he actually intended to conquer ming china hideyoshi had been communicating with the koreans since requesting unmolested passage into china as allies of ming china the koreans at first refused talks entirely and in april and july refused demands that japanese troops be allowed to march through korea the koreans were also concerned that allowing japanese troops to march through korea chosun would mean that masses of ming chinese troops would battle hideyoshis troops on korean soil before they could reach chinaeffectively ruining the chosun economy the sad reality was that the koreans faced a catch because refusing safe_passage for the japanese troops would lead to a japanese attack in august hideyoshi ordered preparations for invasion
in the first campaign hideyoshi appointed ukita hideie to the field_marshal and had them go to the korean peninsula in april konishi yukinaga occupied seoul the capital of the joseon dynasty on may and in only four months hideyoshis forces had a route into manchuria and occupied much of korea korean king seonjo of joseon escaped to pyongyang and requested military_intervention from china in ming chinese emperor wanli sent an army under general li rusong to block the planned invasion of china and recapture the korean peninsula li recaptured pyongyang and surrounded seoul ishida mitsunari massed japanese forces in seoul and halted li rusong and his forces with a serious counterattack the war reached a deadlock and after the conclusion of a cease fire agreement japanese troops retreated to japan 
the birth of hideyoshis second son hideyori in created a potential succession_problem to avoid it hideyoshi exiled his nephew and heir hidetsugu to mount koya and then ordered him to commit_suicide in august hidetsugus family_members who did not follow his example were then murdered in kyoto including women and several children
on february toyotomi hideyoshi had twenty six christians killed as an example to japanese who wanted to convert to christianity they are known as the twenty six martyrs of japan they included five european franciscan missionaries one mexican franciscan missionary three japanese jesuits and seventeen japanese laymen including three young boys they were executed by public crucifixion in nagasaki
after several years of negotiations broken off because envoys of both sides falsely reported to their masters that the opposition surrendered hideyoshi appointed kobayakawa hideaki to lead the invasion_forces but their efforts on the korean peninsula met_with_less_success than the first invasion japanese troops remained pinned in gyeongsang province by june the japanese forces fought with desperation turning back several chinese offensives in suncheon and sacheon as the ming army prepared for a final assault the koreans guerrilla_warfare aided by the fact that they were fighting on their homeland continually harassed japanese forces while hideyoshis last battle at so chon was a major japanese victory all three parties to the war were exhausted and hideyoshi himself now accepted that the war could not be won he told his commander in korea dont let my soldiers become spirits in a foreign land toyotomi hideyoshi died in august his death was kept_secret by the council of five elders to preserve morale and japanese troops were withdrawn from the korean peninsula
because of his failure to capture korea hideyoshis forces were unable to invade china rather than strengthen his position the military_expeditions left his clans coffers and fighting_strength depleted his vassals at odds over responsibility for the failure and the clans that were loyal to the toyotomi name weakened the dream of a japanese empire encompassing asia ended with hideyoshi the tokugawa government not only prohibited any military_expeditions to the mainland but closed japan to nearly all foreigners during the years of the tokugawa shogunate it was not until the late th century that japan would again fight a war against china through korea using much the same route that hideyoshis invasion_force had used
after his death the other members of the council of five regents were unable to keep the ambitions of tokugawa ieyasu in check two of hideyoshis top_generals kato kiyomasa and fukushima masanori had fought bravely during the war but returned to find the toyotomi clan_castellan ishida mitsunari in power he held_the_generals_in_low_esteem and they sided with tokugawa ieyasu hideyoshis underaged son and designated successor hideyori lost the power his father once held and tokugawa ieyasu was declared shogun following the battle of sekigahara
toyotomi hideyoshi changed japanese society in many ways these include imposition of a rigid class_structure restriction on travel and surveys of land and production
class_reforms affected commoners and warriors during the sengoku period it had become common for peasants to become warriors or for samurai to farm due to the constant uncertainty caused by the lack of centralized_government and always tentative peace upon taking_control hideyoshi decreed that all peasants be disarmed completely conversely he required samurai to leave the land and take up residence in the castle_towns this solidified the social_class_system for the next years 
furthermore he ordered comprehensive surveys and a complete census of japan once this was done and all citizens were registered he required all japanese to stay in their respective han fiefs unless they obtained_official_permission to go elsewhere this ensured order in a period when bandits still roamed the countryside and peace was still new the land_surveys formed the basis for systematic taxation
in hideyoshi completed construction of the osaka castle the largest and most formidable in all japan to guard the western approaches to kyoto in that same year hideyoshi banned unfree labor or slavery but forms of contract and indentured labor persisted alongside the period penal_codes forced labor 
hideyoshi also influenced the material_culture of japan he lavished time and money on the tea_ceremony collecting implements sponsoring lavish social_events and patronizing acclaimed masters as interest in the tea_ceremony rose among the ruling_class so too did demand for fine ceramic implements and during the course of the korean campaigns not only were large quantities of prized ceramic ware confiscated many korean artisans were forcibly relocated to japan
inspired by the dazzling golden pavilion in kyoto he also constructed a fabulous portable tea_room covered with gold leaf and lined inside with red gossamer using this mobile innovation he was able to practice the tea_ceremony wherever he went powerfully projecting his unrivaled power and status upon his arrival
politically he set up a governmental_system that balanced out the most powerful japanese warlords or daimyo a council was created to include the most influential lords at the same time a regent was designated to be in command 
just prior to his death hideyoshi hoped to set up a system stable enough to survive until his son grew old enough to become the next leader a was formed consisting of the five most powerful daimyo following the death of maeda toshiie however tokugawa ieyasu began to secure alliances including political marriages which had been forbidden by hideyoshi eventually the pro toyotomi forces fought against the tokugawa in the battle of sekigahara ieyasu won and received the title of seii tai shogun two years later
hideyoshi is commemorated at several toyokuni shrines scattered over japan
ieyasu left in place the majority of hideyoshis decrees and built his shogunate upon them this ensured that hideyoshis cultural_legacy remained in a letter to his wife hideyoshi wrote
because of his low birth and high nobility toyotomi hideyoshi had quite a few names throughout his life at birth he was given the name hiyoshi maru at genpuku he took the name later he was given the surname hashiba and the honorary_court_office chikuzen no kami as a result he was styled his surname remained hashiba even as he was granted the new uji or sei or clan name toyotomi by the emperor his name is correctly toyotomi no hideyoshi using the writing_system of his time his name is written as 
the toyotomi uji was simultaneously granted to a number of hideyoshis chosen allies who adopted the new uji toyotomi no asomi courtier of toyotomi
the catholic sources of the time referred to him as emperor taicosama from taiko a retired kampaku see sessho and kampaku and the honorific sama
his nickname was monkey saru allegedly given by oda nobunaga because of his facial resemblance to a monkey this recognition directly contributed to the popular image of toyotomi hideyoshi being a monkey_styled person both in appearance and mode of behaviour 


wakr is an am radio_station in akron ohio usa operating on khz it is owned by rubber city radio group inc which also owns akrons wone fm and wqmx the station features local news and talk in the morning with an oldies_format throughout the rest of the day 
wakr has also been for many years the akron affiliate for broadcasts of the cleveland indians cleveland browns and cleveland cavaliers their news_department dubbed the akron radio center newsroom and akronnewsnow also feeds drive time news and traffic_updates to sister_stations wone and wqmx updates the companys akronnewsnow local news and information_website and operates an all news internet station dubbed wakrnewsnow 
the station began broadcasting on october founded by s bernard berk and licensed to his family_owned business summit radio corp it became the blue network and then the abc radio_affiliate for akron broadcasting with watts
while crosstown_rival wadc now warf had the advantage of being a cbs affiliate with its popular network_programs wakr built its reputation primarily through local programming supplemented with an active news_department the local emphasis worked and during wakrs peak in and hooper_ratings showed the station with as much as percent of the akron audience
in alan freed joined wakr and became a local favorite playing hot_jazz and pop_recordings when he left the station the non compete clause in his contract limited its ability to find work elsewhere and he was forced to take the graveyard_shift at clevelands wjw radio where he eventually made history playing the music he called rock_and_roll
in berk expanded ownership of summit radio corp by selling to the beacon journal publishing co publishers of the akron beacon journal the newspaper_company would continue to own a piece of summits operations for years
during the s and s wakr was akrons premier radio_station it operated as a very successful top_station during the s competing with cross town whlo wakr also started akrons first fm_station wakr fm in it changed to easy listening waez in the late s and became rock wone fm on january 
wakr also started akrons first television_station wakr tv in originally intended as a vhf_licencee on channel it wound up on channel after an fcc imposed freeze on future vhf_stations as well as a merging of the cleveland and akron markets into one single_market the station moved to channel in and was affiliated with abc despite clevelands wews also holding an abc affiliation many of wakrs personalities shared airtime on the tv_side throughout this time_period current afternoon_host tim daugherty was a weatherman on wakr tv for many years the tv_station changed its callsign to wakc tv in when group one was broken up and it now known as wvpx tv targeted to the cleveland market
since taking to the air wakr has been the home to many personalities who would become national stars among them film_actors lola albright and mark stevens radio_names peter hackes scott muni and charlie greer and the first host of tvs jeopardy art fleming known there as art fazzin
ownership of the berk family broadcasting_interests was organized as group one broadcasting around when it purchased wone am and wone fm later wtue in dayton it bought kbox and kbox fm in dallas in and klz and klz fm in denver in summit radio and group one were dissolved in june and the station passed through four different owners in the next seven years by then wakr was airing a full service adult contemporarypop music format
wakr along with wone fm and the other group one stations were sold to dkm broadcasting in june wakrs license was transferred in september dkm dyson kissner moran sold all of its properties including other stations in dayton dallas denver baltimore springfield and lincoln on january for million to summit communications group which had no connection to summit radio wakrs previous owner
ownership passed to us radio headed by ragan henry on december not too long after the gulf war in early wakr abruptly dropped its standards_format and went into a news_talk_format it featured national hosts rush limbaugh and larry king local talk_hosts bill hall and dave milo plus a morning drive news program hosted by bob allen the lone holdover from the previous format wakr and wone fm were then transferred on december to gordon thomas communications inc headed by thom mandel which also owned wqmx the company changed its name to rubber city radio group on the same day
wakr failed to catch on with the newstalk_format and mandel himself felt a need to revert wakr back to its full_service_format in mid wakr did just that becoming a pop standardstalk hybrid with bob allen bob friend and christie maxx during the daytime and national talk with bruce williams and jim bohannon at night in the station went back to talk but on a more national scale with gary burbank the fabulous sports babe and espn radio_programming eventually added into the schedule news intensive local programming was kept in both morning and afternoon_drive

warrior soul the memoir of a navy_seal chuck pfarrer random house isbn warrior soul is a memoir of former navy_seal chuck pfarrer from the start of his career to his last mission he writes in an honest way although some areas are not specific in which he cites that he cannot reveal that much due to continued secrecy this memoir is praised by the new york times bookseller as the best memoir of a former seal
chuck pfarrer writes about his career beginning with a story of his last mission with seal_team disguised as regular_people the team meets up at norfolk international airport to prepare to board an american airlines boeing for a flight to a unknown destination it is actually a test_mission for military_air_traffic_control in the norfolk virginia area to see if they can detect a free_falling_seal_team and the american airlines plane is actually being flown by a seal thats certified in flying_aircraft the takes off and flies towards florida as a disguised as any regular flight when it suddenly banks back to norfolk switches its identity to a military_aircraft and request the norfolk air traffic control tower to do a touch_and_go_approach to the airport while this is happening chuck and his team are gearing up with all of their gear seals practiced in full combat_gear regardless of the situation given according to chuck and prepared to jump out of the back door of the 
when the begins descending team gets the signal to jump they all jump out of the descending towards the ground not opening parachutes at a certain height the team slowly open their parachutes while for chuck however the situation is grave he cannot open his parachute for a particular reason and now the ground is approaching closely as he passes his team falling towards the ground chuck makes_a_quick_decision in thirty seconds and uses an emergency_cord to open his reserve_chute which it successfully opens at the cost of losing two of his fingernails from ripping at the chord he lands on the ground near demonstration beach and is knocked out but he slowly gets up and laughs off his situation
chuck then goes to tell about his life in the beginning he was born in boston massachusetts and was the son of charles pfarrer a us navy officer and joan marie a nurse and was a brother chuck was baptized as a roman_catholic saying although my family is not the religious type we still ate fish_sticks on fridays i came to accept the saints and teachings in my early life the family moved around to many places including rhode island hawaii and mississippi when he was the family moves down to biloxi mississippi and chucks father leaves them for deployment in vietnam while chucks father was participating in the vietnam war the family_home in biloxi is destroyed by hurricane camille thus making chuck angry at god for the destruction and giving up his religious_faith
sometime later his father comes home and the family moves to rhode island where chuck begins to secretly skipping school to go surfing he actually began doing the sport when the family was in hawaii he describes how he was passionate about the sport adopting the surfer_dude look how rebellious he became unknowingly to his family and how he skipped school just to go surfing he would head directly to the beach to go surfing and as the school_bus came home he made_an_excuse to his that he took_a_shower during pe eventually his parents found out about his exploits when the school_dean called them to say that chuck had low grades in his school chucks father soon gives him a choice of which military_school to go to hoping to discipline his son chuck chooses to go to staunton military_academy not knowing that he did because he was bored he had chosen the toughest military_academy at that time to attend
arriving at the academy chuck is then bullied by various cadets who call him a hippie and other derogative terms due to his surfing_looks he is forced to get rid of it to adapt to the discipline of the academy although chuck does not get in much depth of his life at staunton he describes the general life there he describes how the rigorous lifestyle made him more organized and disciplined but he also describes fellow_cadets there chuck mentions that his fellow_cadets were bastards of hollywood stars sons dictators senators juvenile delinquents and fortune ceos all whom had a diverse skill chuck talks about how this core_group taught him skills that would prove useful later on in his seal_career he learned how to pick locks of car_doors how to unofficially leave the academy grounds without permission to go to town and how to hide contraband he graduates from the academy with a scholarship_offer from
annapolis but rejects it to go attend csu northridge disappointing his father
at csu northridge chuck studies to major in psychology managing his time well regularly earning high grades hoping one day to become a psychologist there he meets his first girlfriend and they both travel to england to studyat the university of bath it is there where his relationship falls apart and chuck returns to california to become an intern at an unknown psychology he realizes how boring life was and finds a sudden desire to becomea navy_seal one day he walks into a naval_recruiting_office and says to the recruiter that he wants to become a navy_seal not before abruptly quitting his job at the psychology_office
the recruiter then questions how he knew what the seals were this was before the seals were known in the media and chuck describes how his father knew them in vietnam when he was there the recruiter declines him a slot to chucks disappointment but chuck strikes him a deal if he can get a slot he will have to attend officer candidate school ocs before getting to attend buds if he dors drop on request or washed out then he would become a green_beret the recruiter agrees and chuck heads back to rhode island to prepare for ocs he sees his ex girlfriend for the last time before shipping out to attend the school after a couple of months in ocs he graduates commissioned as a lieutenant 
right after ocs chuck heads to coronado california to prepare for buds he is given a slot in class where there is little time to prepare for buds during and in the early post vietnam era there was no indoctration_period class begins its first day by getting hammered by the instructors almost all who were vietnam_war_veterans again chuck just describes the general life there he describes the physical_training the class has to do to the numerous men who drop out to how the instructors punish or simply goof off with the students to test their minds he goes through hell week with the class and amazingly no one drops out during the entire week earning it a no bell prize when they would graduate he then describes the post hell week atmosphere from learning the basics of land_warfare to combat diving_physics when it was still in its early stages chuck survives the rigors of buds and graduates with his classmates who all are honored by the instructors as a class that cannot quit
after buds chuck goes to fort benning georgia to attend the army airborne school to earn basic wings he is met by a united states marine corps officer in charge of navy_students attending this school who was not amused nor impressed by buds graduates who attended the school the reason why buds graduates pull_pranks on the airborne school staff was because they wanted to provoke the instructors into punishing them often which buds graduates treat as a joke after spending at least six months in coronado begin hammered by their own instructors with more vigorous pt chuck describes the various pranks the buds graduates all did there to poke_fun of the instructors they climbed up jump_towers to hang beat army banners there they took spray_paint and tagged army officers cars and parking_lots with gay and proud and handicap for hire the marine_officer said if he did any kinds of these pranks with other buds graduates he would instantly be transferred to the regular fleet which chuck takes somewhat seriously sort of
while at airborne school chuck met up with fellow buds students to exercise more than anyone else there just for show and to keep up shape and of course pull_pranks on the final day when chuck was on a c for a graduation_jump his two class friends distract an army instructor to steal his hat and jump before getting caught chuck gets_in_trouble at the drop_zone but fortunately earns his airborne wings given by an army instructor who disliked the buds graduates along with his friends who still have the hat he is becoming closer to becoming a seal at that point at the same time chuck receives orders to report to seal_team four at virginia beach
chuck arrives at virginia beach to begin his advanced operater training with seal_team before he can officially become a navy_seal the team welcomes him by having a couple of enlisted members dunk him in a water_tank before sending him off to gather his new gear he is designated as operator for easy recognition by the team_cadre that looks after the team chuck begins to adapt to his new team meeting up with a friend and officer who arrived earlier frank giffland and a friend from class who have already become seals he begins qualifying for his naval wings which every seal is required to make_ten jumps after his final qualifying_jump chuck is rewarded this unceremoniously by a vietnam_vet master_chief_petty_officer mike boynton whom he greatly respects due to how he covered his office_work so that chuck would be able to participate in team_routines
chuck also begins to train with another vietnam_veteran named chief_petty_officer john jaeger who trains new officers john for some particular reason dislikes chuck in the beginning calling_him_derogative_humor_names whenever he screws up eventually chuck respects john for his way of teaching him on how to be a leader and being a role_model on how to survive in the wilderness chuck also comments on how the team liked john for his diverse background he was rumored to be born in a nazi generic_experiment he was a hard_core smoker who smoked after finishing a swim or any exercise he was an m machine gun gunner in vietnam and loved using the phrase or so after each sentence he said this makes chuck a little more comfortable with the team
as the months go by chuck learns the essential skills of being a seal_operator along with other candidates he learns how to use c in different ways he learns how to avoid bloodhounds russian_tactics how to handle various enemy_weapons and other skills that seals need to learn chuck says that while the newcomers are learning all of this they are being followed by cadre_members known as lane graders who attach themselves to the group thelane graders made sure that a procedure was done right and that no team_member lied during a debriefing they were also there to supervise on the process on becoming seals by checking on how the newcomers work as team and as individuals but if the candidates did not abide by this they were gone
near the end of this process chuck and other members are sent off to participate in robin sage as the opfor the purpose of the seal_presence was to intentionally not allow any green_beret candidate to do anything right bydoing direct_action_missions against them and their pinelander allies the seal_team was to do everything to a high standard otherwise they risk losing their operator_certifications for not being able to winscrewing up chuck is in charge of a team whos objective is to find a green_beret camp and destroy it the team is dropped off in the woods and told to meet a chieu hoi informat
chuck is first skeptical about the informant thinking it was a setup but his already qualified enlisted man baby zee convinces him to meet the informant the informant is a military_police who is playing_the_role of a pinelanderin robin sage who tells chuck on where to find the camp unfortunately for chucks team the informant cannot read a map so chuck had to use his training to figure out where the camp is fortunately the team discovers the campwhen its inhabitants slaughter a live pig for dinner chuck waits until dusk as he prepares to attack the camp
he has one boat_crew a team go on one side of the camp to flank the camp while he had his team move close to the camp from there they were to suppress fire on the camp chuck waits for the green_berets and their patrol to leavethe camp with four others before he orders to fire his team fires first confusing the pinelanders and green_berets making chuck order the other boat_crew to add in additional fire chucks team then charges into the camp kill the pinelanders the green_berets fled and loots it before requesting for a helicopter_extraction the mission was a complete success
sometime later chuck is given his first real_world_assignment to prove that hes worthy of receiving the naval special warfare badge he was not getting a mission that he liked at all observing the us navy test_fire a trident missile the recover its rocket_engine when it detaches chuck and a friend head down to florida to watch the navy test_fire it as they prepared to recover the rocket_engine however soviet trawlers observing also head towards the engine to attempt to retrieve it chuck is left with no choice but to destroy the engine to not let it fall into soviet hands
he and his friend jump from the helicopter with c explosives which they wrapped around the rocket and extracted before it blew up the rocket is destroyed and the soviets failed in retrieving the rocket chuck is considered okay by the team and his finally given the trident at last he was a navy_seal
as an official_member of seal_team four now chuck gets into the routine of the regular seal_life besides spending numerous hours training on the base or at fort ap hill the team is deployed at some point overseas with theregular navy in which chuck still is unspecific in these deployments are not classified yet on the non_combat side of life the team often frequented a bar in virginia beach that has been inhabited by the udt and the first seals over the years chuck also dates a number of women during this time he first dates a nurse then a naval_o and many others but was not successful in getting a long_term_relationship
as the years go by chuck gets command of his own platoon in the team he remains friends with frank giffland who he is influenced by while befriending others in his new platoon one of theseis a navy_corpsman named doc who is a vietnam_veteran the platoon heads down to the panama canal to participate in a joint military_exercise with the panamanian defense forces withmany seals having a skeptical thought on them chuck reveals that some of the panamanians were the soldiers waiting to kill seals years later during operation nifty package during this exercise the joint team successfully raid the gatun locks and other facilities surrounding the canal the final exercise which consisted only of seals including one of chucks aot_instructor john jaeger is to simulate a takeover and sinking of a us navy ship
for obvious reasons chuck is vague in the description of the takeover of the ship but concludes that the exercise was a successful task for the seals participating and it creates a friendship between john and chuck some days later chuck and johns platoon flights home are delayed so both men let their teams head to bars in town chuck and john decide to follow some of them and strip off their insignia_rates to go into the enlisted bar there they find tension building up between members of force recon green_berets and seals who are ready to beat each other up john finally ends the tension when he attracts all the attention to himself and gets a tall green_beret to look after the men while he went to the bathroom this ends the tension between all the special_forces_men in the enlisted bar
home for the new_year chuck sends his platoon to their own homes and families to celebrate the new_year while staying back to keep watch over the teams base finding that there was really nothing else to do chuck heads off to a party that he is invited to by a friend who works closely with the seals he is a nightstalker at the party he meets margot a woman from buffalo new york who is a mutual friend they soon quickly leave the party and head to margots house chuck waits for margot when she appears to him nude and they have_sex this begins hisfirst long_term_relationship with margot
some time later chuck and frank are given_notices by the command to do a special task one of them are to do a hydrographic_recon on a beach near puerto leimpra honduras for a naval_force to land there chuck and frank at first head down to honduras do a personal recon themselves with a cia_agent of the area they both find a suitable beach to recon before heading hometo prepare to return frank decides to take the platoon to ap hill for initial combat_testing while chuck is left with the task of the recon 
he picks four others to do the task with him surfer dave stan tim and bubba once he does the group is put_on_isolation while the rest of the platoon head up to ap hill the next day the groupis flown over the uss fairfax and free_fall to the ocean before meeting up with the ship onboard the captain and chuck discuss the recon and chuck goes over all the details with the groupbefore the mission begins the fairfax goes into commercial_shipping_traffic before giving chucks team the signal to release their zodiac boat into the sea the group heads towards honduras to begin their recon
chucks boat encounters big waves while heading into the surf_zone near the bay where the beach was located thanks to chucks knowledge of surfing they make it safely into the bay putting a rendevousmarker into the bay the team puts_their_boat_on_shore then splits to conduct a hydrographic_recon of the beach as soon as they finish they head to the boat to go to the rendevous_point they set up but themarker is mysteriously missing when the team gets there alerting chuck they soon discover a nicaraguan patrol_boat that had entered the bay founded the marker and were now looking for the seal_team inside the bay
the team not wanting to be discovered quietly moves toward a fishing_pier to hide under it before they could they awaken two natives who live on the pier tim attempts to speak spanish to them but to no avail but chuck discovers that they spoke french he explains that the natives cannot snitch the team to the patrolboat in which they obey thanking them when they did not chuck gives one of the natives his knife before moving the boat out
deciding to stall the patrol_boat which was close but not alerted yet chuck ties glowsticks together andhooks them to a tree while the patrol_boat opens fire on the glowsticks the team move out of the bay tohead towards the surf_zone as they rode a wave they are shocked to see that the patrol_boat follows out ofthe bay too fortunately for the team the surf stalls the patrol_boat and is broached there as the team head out into the ocean after a deadly game of hide_and_seek the team finds the fairfax 
back on the boat after numerous hours in the sea the team debriefs on what they found and the incident with the nicaraguan boat that was looking for them it was later revealed that a navy_personnal had betrayed them by giving codes to the soviets who then relayed the information to the nicaraguans john walker had known about this operation thus creating the incidentfor chucks team
at a bar in puerto leimpara chuck receives news from his commanding_officer that his platoon was to be shipped to a new battle_front
breaks the news to the rest of the men in the squad that are with him they were going to lebanon
