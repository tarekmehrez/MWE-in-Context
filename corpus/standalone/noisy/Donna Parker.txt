Donna Parker is the lead character of a seven-volume girls' series that was written by Marcia Martin from the 1950s through the 1960s.
First published by Whitman from 1957 through 1964 in thick glossy picture cover editions, the series was revamped with new cover art in the late 1960s and then reprinted with a smaller, non-glossy picture cover. The series was discontinued by the mid-1970s.
But Donna has recently gained a bit of fame in the 21st century. The book "Donna Parker, Special Agent" is included in an exhibit at The Newseum in Washington, D.C. The Newseum, which displays all manner of news media memorabilia and artifacts, has a current exhibition titled "G-Men and Journalists," featuring prominent spy capers and crime stories. Donna's cheerful face and waving hand are front and center along with other books in the display. A photo of the display appeared in the Washington Post Sunday Magazine on April 26, 2009.
